Sundaram's decision has left the DDCA in a fix as they need to identify by Wednesday the man who will take charge of the pitches and the ground during the IPL. Sundaram, who was the BCCI's chief curator till 2012 and was roped in when Kotla was banned for a year in 2010, was reportedly unhappy with DDCA for bowing to Delhi skipper Gautam Gambhir's demands and his alleged interference in the preparation of the pitches.  Sundaram had distanced himself from the Kotla during Delhi's last Ranji Trophy match in December last and DDCA vice-president Chetan Chauhan has been looking after the ground since then. ""The way the ground has been misused by DDCA isn't acceptable. They have let senior players dictate terms. Even now, with the IPL around the corner, they are playing league matches there. I can't work with such an association where there is too much interference from all quarters,"" Sundaram told TOI on Tuesday.  ""We have asked him to rethink. But he has finally said no. We will appoint someone by Wednesday. We are trying all options within the DDCA,"" Chauhan, who is reluctant to take up full-time responsibility, said. ""I was only looking after the ground. I can't get into pitch-making,"" he added.  Ankit Datta, who has been assisting Sundaram at the Kotla for the last few years, is said to the most likely replacement for Sundaram. Ankit, in his late 20s, has passed all BCCI exams to become a qualified curator and has impressed senior people in BCCI. But he too has his issues with the DDCA.  ""Ankit has been really impressive and has learnt very quickly. He is good enough to take charge. But the DDCA hasn't paid him well. He doesn't know what he is supposed to get. This is DDCA's internal problem. Let them deal with it. If needed we'll have a word with them,"" said a BCCI official.  Sources in DDCA said Sundaram wasn't paid for his work.

Taking a serious note of the non-compliance of its previous order to conduct an inquiry into the Dara Singh case, a division bench comprising Justice Markandey Katju and Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra observed on Friday: “It is deeply disappointing that the CBI has not yet completed the investigation despite the order of this court dated April 9, 2010.” The court further said: “On the request of the learned counsel for CBI, we grant two months’ further time to complete the investigation, failing which a serious view will be taken by this court about the functioning of the CBI.” The court then asked CBI to file a status report by March 8, 2011. “Justice Katju made an open remark that the CBI officials need to be whipped to get the investigation done and this being the disappointing situation they must all resign and join some other service. Justice Mishra also objected to the CBI asking for more time to investigate a fake encounter which took place in 2006 and asked the IO whether he can assure his resignation in case the investigation is not completed in the two months more time as being prayed,” said S K Sinha, counsel for Sushila Devi, widow of Dara Singh, talking to TOI.  As per the case, Dara Singh was a wanted man carrying a reward of Rs 25,000 and was killed during an encounter with police at Mansarovar area in Jaipur. After his death, his widow Sushila approached the police and even filed a complaint but now FIR was registered. It was only after SC’s intervention that the investigation was sent to CBI and an FIR was registered in April, 2010. The Supreme Court has recently asked the CBI to file a status report regarding the progress of investigation but instead of filing the report, the CBI requested the court to drop the proceedings initiated by Sushila Devi.

The 23.3-km-long Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar stretch would be the third Metro corridor in the city and is expected to cost Rs8,313 crore. The state government had approved the proposal for the Metro stretch in the first week of January. According to the Centre’s new Metro policy, the project was awaiting the Centre’s 20% viability-gap funding of Rs1,300 crore. The state is supposed to generate Rs812 crore. The delay in allocation had raised questions about the viability of the model. Finally, the central government’s finance department cleared funds for the project. “The central government’s approval and fund allocation has put the project on track and we should finalize the tendering process and decide the bidder for the project in the coming two months and sign the agreement thereafter,” said Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) commissioner Kiran Gitte, who was in Delhi for the meeting with the finance department. The successful bidder will have to bring in 60% funding for the project — 30% in equity and 70% in debt. The central government had raised several queries regarding the PPP model, which had even forced PMRDA to keep a backup option and funds ready at the state level through land monetization. Gitte said with the central government sanctioning funds, things would be on track and all approvals will be speeded up. The work on Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar stretch is expected to be carried out in phases. The first phase, between Hinjewadi and Balewadi, will be completed by April 2019 and the second phase, between Balewadi and Shivajinagar, will be completed by 2021. PMRDA has shortlisted three companies — Tata Realty Siemens, IRB in consortium with Chinese and Malaysian companies and ILFS — who could bid for the project. With the clearance from the central government, the bid should take place by June. All the stations will be equipped with the latest technology, amenities and state-of-the-art infrastructure. The entire Metro stretch is expected to be monitored by automated technologies. According to the plan, Metro will ply through Hinjewadi, Wakad, Balewadi, Pune University and Shivajinagar. At Shivajinagar junction, it will align with the other two Metro corridors.

A source in the Congress said Chavan had communicated his unhappiness to the party high command. According to the source, he told the party top brass that the NCP was playing the role of the BJP’s ‘B’ team and the Congress must not join hands with it. The leaders against the tie-up stressed the party should instead strengthen its own base to avoid further dip in its political fortunes. The Congress and NCP decided to join hands in panchayats and zilla parishads following a meeting between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and state Congress president Ashok Chavan on Sunday. The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Ashok Chavan said the party had accepted the NCP’s proposal that both the parties should join hands in zilla parishads and panchayats to keep the Sena-BJP out of power.

Soon after the video went viral on social media, a case was registered at Falaknuma Police Station, Hyderabad, under Indian Penal Code’s Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs). the actress then approached the Supreme Court, seeking to quash the FIR lodged against her as well as the director and producer of the Oru Adaar Love. 

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court stayed all criminal proceedings against Priya Prakash Varrier and said that in future, no FIR can be lodged against Varrier in connection with the promotional song, Manikya Malaraya Poovi.
In her petition, the actress argued that “criminal complaints have been instituted by various fringe groups based on a distorted and incorrect interpretation of the song in the states of Telangana, Maharashtra and similar complaints are likely from other non- Malayalam speaking states as well.” 

The petition also contended that the “song is originally from an old folk song from Kerala which was written in 1978 by PMA Jabbar and was first sung by Thalassery Rafeeq, in the praise of the Prophet and his wife Beevi Khadija” and that “the claims that it hurts the religious sentiments are without any basis. The song is a Mappila Song, and therefore a part of the Muslim tradition in Kerala and does not offend any religious sentiment of any community or person,” she added. 

Keeping in mind that two more FIRs have been registered against the actress, one with Mumbai Police and another at Jinsi police station at Aurangabad, the three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra ordered that no state across the country shall entertain any criminal action or complaints against Varrier or the film’s director and producer in connection with the song.

This has resulted in death or disappearance of about 20 tigers which entered Telangana from Maharashtra, she said. She said lack of supervision by the forest officials in the tiger reserve was helping the poachers to intrude into the forest area and kill the wild cats for their skin, which is in much demand. Besides this, illegal sand mining and timber smuggling are the other reasons for destruction of tiger habitat in the Kawal reserve, she noted.The petitioner sought an inquiry by an independent committee into the existing system of management of tiger reserve and measures taken to curb illegal activities like poaching, encroachments, timber smuggling, sand mining and so on, and to investigate into the death and disappearance of all the tigers from the Kawal reserve. She sought setting up of a special strike force to curb poaching and intensive patrolling. Further, she sought a direction to the state government to take steps for protecting the tigers from being killed by strengthening the security system in the reserve.

With the Justice RM Lodha Committee recommending a three-member selection panel - based on its findings from Cricket Australia (CA) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - and the Committee of Administrators (CoA) demanding that the recommendations be implemented, Kumble found the need for a national coach to be on that panel of selectors. Cricket Australia (CA) and the ECB have their national coaches on the panel. Australia's national coach Darren Lehmann and his England counterpart Trevor Bayliss, nevertheless, have had their share of troubles being part of the selection panel. While there could be a positive side to the coach being a selector - in terms of understanding horses for courses policy and voting in favour of the right player in right conditions against particular oppositions -there are also negatives that need to be considered. ""If a player does the right thing and opens up with the coach about his weaknesses and shares his fears? Let's say a batsman approaches the coach and says 'I'm having a problem tackling googlies' or 'I'm struggling with the short delivery'. The coach works with the player but as a selector, he's bound to keep in mind what the player shared with him,"" says a cricketer-turned-administrator. Cricketers have faced such complications in the past and a prime example is Virender Sehwag, who went on to compliment Kirsten for the hours of conversation they would have on the former opener's batting worries. ""In such a scenario, the cricketer might just stop sharing his fears with the coach. That's a possible scenario and not a healthy one,"" he adds. Another case in point is whether the coach-cum-national selector has time to watch cricket across the length and breadth of the country given his hectic schedule with the national team. ""It's the kind of issue that Bayliss had to deal with in England,"" says a former cricketer.

Scientists have now developed the technology to power heart pump wirelessly thus saving thousands of lives, and eventually offering an alternative to heart transplants. The wireless pump uses magnetic fields to transfer power through skin rather than using wire cables and can be powered this way 24 hours a day for a lifetime. The new technology came out of collaboration among scientists from University of Auckland's Bio-engineering Institute, departments of electrical and computer engineering and physiology. A new company, TETCor, was created to market the technology for powering a wide range of such implanted devices. TETCor CEO Simon Malpas says heart pumps need a huge amount of power. The only way to power current artificial heart pumps is through a wire cable that goes through a patient's stomach and chest, according to an Auckland University release. These wires cause serious infections, sometimes leading to death, in about forty percent of patients. The wires are also prone to breaking and restrict a patient's activities, said Malpas. ""This new wireless heart pump weights only 92 grams and measures just seven cm by three cm. It uses a coil outside a person's body to generate a magnetic field. A second coil placed inside a person's body, near the collar bone, picks up the signal from this field and creates power for the pump."" Malpas says previous attempts at making wireless heart pumps produced too much heat. These earlier pumps would have ended up ""cooking a person from the inside"".

The Governor and his wife Jean Rodrigues served hot cooked food to the disadvantaged children in a homely environment.In a brief address' General Rodrigues expressed his concern over the malnutrition figures of 62 per cent in UT government schools as per a survey carried out by the health department of UT. He said there should be constant monitoring of the health status of schoolchildren by medical teams and a periodical review by the senior officers of the administration. He said under this action plan' teams of doctors would visit schools once in a month' to provide nutrition supplements. ...All anaemic and worm-infected children would be provided necessary treatment in the schools' and teachers would be educated and assigned the task of administering the requisite dose of medicine' with follow-up and updated database.Similarly' he said' the children who need further medical and dental treatment and eye check-ups would be referred to the main hospitals.Stressing the need for greater community participation in this programme' General Rodrigues asked the teachers and the agencies assigned the task of preparing cooked food for the children to oversee the preparations and distribution of meals to the children. ...He also suggested the need for mobilising mothers of the children and other self-help groups into participating in this scheme' by periodic visits.Giving a brief account of the scheme' home secretary Krishna Mohan and DS Mangat' DPI (Schools) said all the 60 model and non-model schools in rural and colony areas with a student strength of 25'000 in the primary classes would be provided with cooked meals' which would be arranged by four agencies.

Nearly 50 vehicles from the 747 were stolen from paid parking lots.  On the other hand, in 2012, 894 vehicles were stolen. Out of these, 75 were stolen from paid parking lots.  Police say it is difficult to track the accused as they sell the vehicles in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh at throwaway prices, holding the porous borders with Punjab and Haryana as a key factor that facilitates vehicle thefts.  “Most of the stolen vehicles, especially cars and jeeps, are sold in markets of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The accused change the chassis numbers and also make fake registration papers. Vehicles are sold at very cheap prices and later used as taxis by buyers,” says a police official here.  He adds it is difficult to ascertain that the vehicle is stolen as for jeeps with make of before 2011, the help of Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) is needed.  Sports utility vehicles (SUVs), especially Bolero jeeps, remained the favourite of auto lifters in Chandigarh. Over 25 Boleros have been stolen from the city till now.

Luckily, no one was walking on the spot at the time. Though the cause was a retaining wall beneath the footpath giving in to the pressure of sea waves, fingers are being pointed at shoddy construction work, which heavy rain exposed. The promenade and the road along it are the property of the Bombay Port Trust (BPT).  Though it’s not even a fortnight into the monsoon, cave-ins and crater formations are being routinely reported, casting a shadow on the assurances of civic authorities about an incident-free rainy season.  Last Friday, near Churchgate station, a portion of a footpath above a sewer line caved in. Also, corporators are question the desilting claims of the BMC administration since the city’s nullahs have been unable to drain out rainwater, which has led to flooding. Opposition corporators are questioning the Shiv Sena-BJP ruled BMC about the monsoon mess in the city despite crores being spent on rain-preparedness.  Shifting blame, particularly for potholes, BMC officials say there are no problems on recently constructed roads and most potholes are being reported from roads in the interiors. The largest number of potholes have been reported from the western suburbs. For the Andheri-Kurla road below Metro tracks, where many potholes have surfaced, BMC officials have blamed the MMRDA, saying it did not maintain the road and handed it over to the BMC just before the monsoon. An official said a third-party audit of pothole repair work will be done.  “Every time BMC officials blame the geography of the city and other issues for such problems. Why don’t they come up with a plan keeping all such problems in mind? After all, the city faces the same set of problems every monsoon,” said Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh.  As for nullah desilting, the Congress has alleged massive corruption in the work. The municipal commissioner even assured the party that the BMC may file a police case against a civic contractor after an inquiry.  Additional municipal commissioner SVR Srinivas said the BMC will be able to deal with heavy rain in the coming days. “We have decided to start pumps in areas with waterlogging and clean drainage lines regularly.” ","['police', 'suicide', 'body', 'murder', 'found', 'family', 'arrested', 'two', 'said', 'near']",Crime,four policeman beaten sector police post resident sector tuesday police managed arrest five incident took place asi azad posted sector police post rounded person fighting creating nuisance said one sunil called brother resident ram arrived odd person including group forced entry police post started misbehaving azad police manhandled uniform constable duty tried intervene received police force called managed free azad singh constable unruly azad suffered minor person booked charge assaulting public servant causing parmod udayvir munni,Civic,No,,
