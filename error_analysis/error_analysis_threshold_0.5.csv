Talking to TOI's Yudhvir Rana, he says Gurdaspur has so far been represented by 'outsiders' but he will be with the voters round the clock.You are pitted against seasoned and influential politicians backed by established political parties. Being a new entrant in politics do you find yourself in a tight spot?Not at all, my competition is with no one but myself. Be sides, being a local, my party is my strength. I think voters have the power to tell how a seasoned, wealthy, influential or even a rejected politician is. I am approaching voters saying that I'll be with them 24X7, in all good and not-so-good times. This constituency has largely been represented by outsiders.The AAP is a young party and political parties need some time to mature. People have tolerated 120-year-old party for so long, let's tolerate this emerging political party for at least a decade to witness the difference in governance and performance. How do you look at the circumstances which are leading to farmers' suicides?Our state has multiple farm-related problems. I am a farmer's son and have witnessed drought in 1963 and in 1965. I know how it feels when someone sells his utensils to buy one meal a day . Complete loan waiver is not an answer to farmers' predicament. We have to go into the genesis of the issue. I believe in an ancient Chinese axiom which says `Give a man a fish and you have fed him once, teach him how to fish and you have fed him for lifetime'. This region of Punjab has contributed maximum during the green revolution. Farmers are sinking under a debt trap. Governments announce loan waivers, they (farmers) again borrow loans. It's a vicious circle. We have to make them self-reliant and no one is doing that. So far, how has your journey from a decorated soldier to a politician been?Of course, I'm new to politics. I'm trying to learn its nuances and like my successful carrier in the Ar my, hoping to successfully sail through this too. I've finished my responsibilities and have all the time in this world for the people of Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency. Besides, a soldier speaks from heart and I speak to the people from heart. I promise my people only one thing, that I will be their voice in Delhi Darbar. What are the key issues of your constituency?First and foremost issue is the lack of proper education infrastructure. When I was studying here, there were schools without roofs or benches. Ironically, they still exist, and there is not a single institute for higher education in the entire area. Textile mills have either closed down or shifted to neighbouring tax haven states, youth are in despair and frustrated for there are no job opportunities. There are various means to revive and rejuvenate the sluggish governance. I have a few things in mind but I can't discuss them at this stage. Any new industry which you would want to bring to Gurdaspur?Tourism is one. We have abundance of unexploited natural treasure. Dunera has beautiful landscapes and tourists who go to Dalhousie can be attracted to lower hills, where we can develop water sports etc. But unfortunately, the traditional politicians have always neglected the area's tourism potential and have remained busy making promises they never fulfil.

  Tut-tut, our Bollywood reporter — no doubt, still tripping from the high of the BT 16th Anniversary Halloween bash last Friday — failed to include Karan Johar in our pages of party coverage on Tuesday.
   
  And that’s a pity, because Bollywood’s prolific filmmaker came as himself, as debonair as ever, elegantly suited and booted in a wildly celebrating venue full of party animals given the license to come in costume as ghoul and ghost, witch and vampire. 
  
  And he did that for us, despite a growing tiredness that was making him drag his feet; despite the nagging thought that he had a midnight flight to take to Rome where his My Name Is Khan was showing at the Rome Film Festival; despite the fact that he had just packed in a press conference and had been pushing body, mind and soul before that over four episodes of his new season of Koffee With Karan that opens on Sunday with Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan. 
  
  Not to mention the card parties and dinner with Ekta Kapoor that completed KJo’s calendar last week. Poor man! The result was he never made it to Rome and from there to Berlin — where he was to celebrate buddy Shah Rukh Khan’s 45th birthday. KJo was down with malaria the same night. And advised bed rest for 12 days. That’s where he is now, taking the weight of Bollywood off his feet, catching up on sleep, missing friends, and restless as hell. He was too weak to even call up SRK and wish the Bollywood Badshah on his birthday. And that’s making us feel awful. 
  
  Also guilty, because KJo might have gone onto Rome and Berlin, perhaps to discover the malaria there. Instead, he came all the way downtown to wish us on our anniversary. And we forgot to count him among those who had. A thousand apologies...

At the same time, the ratings agency has downgraded the bank’s baseline credit assessment to Caa2 from B3. The placing of Yes Bank’s deposit rating of B2 under review reflects Moody’s expectation that the lender’s standalone viability is getting increasingly challenged by its slowness in raising new capital. The ratings agency said that the potential credit risk to the bank’s creditors is uncertain because there are several diverse scenarios that could affect it in either positive or negative directions. Yes Bank is in discussions with a number of investors to raise new equity capital, which would be credit-positive if executed successfully. If the bank successfully recapitalises, repairs and cleans its balance sheet, its ratings could stabilise or be upgraded. According to Moody’s, if a private sector solution is unsuccessful, and a regulatory led resolution is implemented, Moody’s expects that Indian authorities will strive to maintain systemic stability and avoid losses to depositors and senior creditors. Any concrete measures from Indian authorities to resolve the bank without losses to the depositors and senior creditors could also lead to a stabilisation or an upward movement in the bank’s ratings. “Because the viability of the bank absent a large capital injection is in question, Moody’s has downgraded the bank’s standalone credit profile or its BCA to Caa2 from B3,” said Moody’s vice-president and senior credit officer Alka Anbarasu. A scenario where neither a private sector recapitalisation nor balance sheet repair are forthcoming would be credit-negative, and could lead to a downward movement of the bank’s ratings.

Banks are seeing limited upside on a proposal where they will have to make large upfront provisions and wait for a long time for offloading the equity they will hold through debt conversion. This means that chances of lenders approving a restructuring package for the airline, without a government nudge, are low. On Friday, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar’s meeting with bureaucrats in the aviation ministry raised speculation of a new resolution plan for Jet Airways. Hardeep Puri, the newly-appointed minister of state with independent charge of aviation ministry, was petitioned on social media by employees and customers of the grounded airline to help revive it. Sources said that the proposal Hinduja group has in mind involves a huge haircut, fresh loans and partnership by Etihad and one more financial investor. “They (Hindujas) are aware that there are no other bidders and that in an airline there is not much scope for recovery through the bankruptcy route,” said a banker. But despite not having alternatives, lenders are reluctant as there is a likelihood of the airline coming under a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). Besides the overhang of investigation, Jet Airways has seen its top management exit. On Thursday the airline said that it was not able to approve its annual results due to the large-scale attrition in its board and senior management. While announcing SBI’s financial results earlier this month, Kumar had said that the bank had made disproportionate efforts in reviving the airline to which it had a Rs 1,600-crore exposure. He said that the bank had already started making provisions towards these loans. Among others, the second-largest lender Punjab National Bank has not yet classified Jet Airways as a non-performing asset (NPA) but has made provisions towards its loan. IDBI Bank has classified Jet as an NPA and has made provisions. Should the banks agree to an 80% haircut they will have to immediate make provisions in their financial results as what they have set aside is less than half of their loan. According to a senior executive with an asset reconstruction company (ARC), bankers can look at parking their loans with an ARC. This will enable them to facilitate a revival without management of several banks having to expend efforts on their loan with a very small recovery.

With temperatures crossing 45 degrees and even handpumps drying up, 80% of Panjhiri village in a remote part of Damoh district have locked up and left. Migration for jobs is common in villages of Bundelkhand. But now they are being driven out by thirst. The water woes in Panjhiri started as early as April — a sad reflection of how basic infrastructure is little more than a mirage in these parts. By early May, things were unbearable. All three tube wells went dry. The village is in Sahajpura panchayat, which has 13 handpumps. Three of them are in Panjhiri. And all three crank out hot air these days. People started moving out in a trickle. Now, only those who can’t, have stayed back. With monsoon likely to be delayed, more villages may get deserted. The entire Tendukheda block, where Panjhir lies, is parched. Of the 181 villages in this block, more than 100 face acute water shortage and people have to walk 2-5 km to fetch a bucket of water. Rows of locked houses in Panjhir bear testament to how bad things are. Those who are left behind spend half their time in search of water. Panjhiri, located on a hillock near Patan tehsil of Jabalpur, has a mixed population of scheduled caste and backward communities. Forced homeless by thirst, most of them work as rickshawpullers in Jabalpur and spend nights on the footpath. Vandana Ahirwar, one of the women left behind in the small hillock hamlet, said, “We have to walk 8km to fetch water. You can’t imagine how gruelling it is to walk that far and back in this heat with a matka on your head. Some of the water we get with so much pain spills along the way.” Bhima Ahirwar, who couldn’t take it any longer and migrated last week, said, “If you spend half of your day in search of a pot of water, when will you work?” Sarpanch of the panchayat, Priti Khangar, said the administration was informed several times about the water crisis and non-functioning tubewells but in vain. Her husband Ganesh Khangar said villagers migrated because of water scarcity. District panchayat officials admit there is “acute water scarcity” in the village but refused to link it to migration. Collector Neeraj Singh, said, “I will personally visit the village and ensure that water scarcity is resolved.” ","['land', 'housing', 'estate', 'developer', 'property', 'flat', 'real', 'plot', 'development', 'builder']",RealEstate,new delhi development authority putting seal approval policy meeting people already lured buying builder actually plan policy real estate expert worry builder luck shortchanging potential buyer offering home land new land policy free urban mostly periphery small landholding village surrendered create infrastructure like road return substantial portion land last delhi government declared village urban village eligible land area covering village north delhi divided like dwarka emerge pooled real regulation requiring certain norm building developer soliciting buyer presumption land available book ask office call process builder confided toi reporter posed potential flat though project cannot launched without obtaining building plan sanctioned registration formality gullible buyer committed money housing exist developer fraudulently collected lakh advance payment interested builder shut shop vanished collecting huge cautioned mukesh advised buyer verify document credibility developer investing dda aware initiated communication programme clarify policy yet become unscrupulous promoter opened kiosk dwarka locality neighbouring distribute pamphlet brochure promoting housing said dda dda official received text message scheme,WaterResources,No,,

However, traders on Tuesday allowed around 100 truckloads of tomatoes to cross the border to prevent losses to Indian traders while around 50 trucks of cement arrived from Pakistan. Goods worth Rs 350 crore are traded monthly between the two countries through ICP.  The traders' association and Attari Truck Operators' Union have joined hands to suspend trade demanding proper facilities at the ICP.  In the wake of Eid, there was huge demand for tomatoes, vegetables and meat in Pakistan. Similarly dry fruits were in huge demand in India. But the festivities could be hit due to the indefinite strike at ICP, said president of Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Associations and an importer and exporter, Anil Mehra. No trader wanted to suspend trade, but they were forced to do so since they had to bear losses, he said.  President of Cement Importers' Association, M P Singh Chatha, said, ""Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) has failed to provide proper infrastructure at ICP due to which trade with Pakistan was not flourishing. We need goods in the same condition in which they are sent by Pak exporters, but goods often get damaged here due to carelessness of CWC.""  He also blamed CWC for charging demurrage as and when truck enters from Pakistan. ""We should be given at least 72 hours' time for clearance and loading of goods,"" he said.  Executive member of truck union Parminder Singh said that sometimes they have to wait for three days for their turn for clearance of goods. He said only drivers are allowed to go inside ICP and not the helper and in case of rain, driver alone couldn't cover the truck with tarpaulin. When the goods are damaged in rain, dealers often ask transporters to pay compensation, he said.  Truck driver Amarjit Singh said there was only one weighing machine at ICP and hundreds of trucks queue up for weighing, making it a time-consuming exercise. ""We have to stay inside ICP for clearance for more than six hours and there is no basic infrastructure for us like toilet or canteen,"" he said.  CWC manager Rameshwar said, ""We have all the space and infrastructure at ICP"". On charges by traders about Pak cement or other goods getting damaged in rain, he said many a time, Pak customs or Rangers also check the goods and remove the tarpaulin from the truck. If it rains then, the goods were bound to get wet in rain.  Similarly, he said, when trucks from Pakistan cross Indian border, the tarpaulin was removed for rummaging and other security checks. ""We can't help if it rains then, but these are very rare incidents,"" he said. There were certain technical reasons like formalities of customs clearance, etc., which takes time. ""Transporters and traders are not ready to understand these issues,"" he said.  BOX  Rs 150-crore complex  Former home minster P Chidambaram had laid the foundation stone for ICP on February 20, 2010, with a view to boost trade and commerce between India and Pakistan. It was constructed at a cost of Rs 150 crore on 130 acres of land acquired by the Punjab government. On April 13, 2012, Chidambaram had inaugurated the ICP.  Box  Main trade items  Goods, including fresh vegetables, soybean, cotton, polypropylene, polyethylene, carbon dioxide, etc., are exported to Pakistan while items like cement, soda ash, gypsum, glass, rags, sugar and dry dates were imported from Pakistan via ICP.  BOX  Meeting today  Keeping in view the Indo-Pak trade crisis, especially so ahead of the festive season, the custom officials have convened a meeting of representatives of traders, truck operators, CWC and civil administration. The meeting will be held on Wednesday, said president of Cement Importers Association MP Singh Chatha.

Built in eight years and completed in 1931, the church has high arches and delicate domes and is said to resemble a birthday cake with a candle placed on top. For the first time, it will undergo a comprehensive conservation programme conducted by the church committee under the supervision of India National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. The project is being completely funded through donations by churchgoers.  Located east of Parliament House and Rashtrapati Bhavan which was used by the British Viceroy, the Cathedral Church of Redemption derives its name from Palladio's Church of Il Redentore in Venice. According to historians, the church’s centralized plan blends neatly with Sir Edwin Lutyens’ city plan.  “With Viceroy Lord Irwin’s keen support, the church, built according to Henry Alexander Medd’s (1892-1977) design, was opened for public worship on Sunday, January 18, 1931. Medd’s design was inspired by the Palladio Church of Il Redentore in Venice as well as Lutyens’ Hampstead church,” reads a description of the building. Through the decades, however, the building has suffered wear and tear. While the interiors have seen repairs over the years, this is the first time the exterior façade will be the focus of conservation.  Construction work of the church started in 1927 and was completed in 1931. The domes were added by 1935. “The church was considered a majestic part of the new capital city and has witnessed history. A few years ago, the interiors of the church saw elaborate restoration including rewirings, repairing, flooring and polishing. Now our focus is on the conservation of the exteriors of the church. Church members are all pledging money for the work over a period of a year in installments,” said Rev Paul Swaroop.  The project would cost approximately Rs 1.3 crore. Major areas of concern seen in the church are algae growth, accumulation of dust, water seepage, flaking and disintegration of plaster, vegetation growth, paint layer over fenestrations and at the fixing joints, weathering of red sandstone at plinth and flooring of porches. “The column capitals are also defaced and have stains on them. Superficial cracks can be seen wherever the surfaces have been plastered,” said an official.  According to Reverend Paul Swaroop, the church committee had approached the government several times to conserve the building which is listed as a Grade A heritage building. “In spite of approaching the government several times, we only got empty assurances. We were told during Commonwealth Games that the government would allocate money for the church’s conservation. The committee then decided to take over. Intach was brought in as a consultant. We invited tenders for conservation of the church and evaluated the responses before awarding the contract. Intach will supervise the project,” he said.

The convict (name withheld) has been in jail since his arrest on September 12, 2015. The Hadapsar police had chargesheeted him for offences punishable under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and for aggravated sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Special judge (POCSO Act) G P Agrawal found the accused guilty based on the evidence on record, including the survivor and her brother’s deposition. The judge also relied on the provisions under Section 29 of the POCSO Act, which state that there is presumption of commission of offence unless the contrary is proved. The court directed the district legal service aid authority to take steps for grant of apt compensation to the survivor under the Maharashtra Victim Compensation Scheme. “The victim has suffered enormous mental and physical pain due to the shameful act of her father and, therefore, she needs to be adequately compensated in terms of money,” judge Agrawal said. Special public prosecutor Suresh Gawali had examined six witnesses — the survivor’s mother, who had lodged an FIR against the accused, the survivor, her brother, the medical experts examining the girl and investigating officer Rupali Pawar — in support of the prosecution’s case. The accused claimed that he was falsely implicated by his wife, who had previously lodged a case against him for subjecting her to cruelty, and he was acquitted in that case. He took the defence that the girl’s age was not adequately proved, there was a two-day delay in the registration of the FIR and the girl’s medical examination did not support the prosecution’s case. Gawali had argued that the survivor and her brother’s statements were consistent, their conduct was natural, and they had no reason to falsely implicate their father. The court observed that there were no material contradictions in the deposition by star witnesses — the survivor and her brother — and there was no reason to disbelieve their testimonies. The judge also cited the Supreme Court rulings to the effect that in sexual crime against woman, the survivor’s testimony if found cogent, consistent and reliable, alone is sufficient for conviction of the accused. The court also relied on the complainant-mother’s evidence, and the findings of the medical experts and the investigating officer.

Rajan Naik from Narayan nagar, Honda, and Sunil Gaonkar from Bhuipal, Sattari, were nabbed by patrolling forest guards for attempting to poach wild animals at the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary on the night of November 6.

""The grant will not be delayed any more by MHRD or UGC. MHRD is already very concerned about the difficulty being faced by PU in releasing salaries and pensions for teachers and all other staff,"" said Grover. The VC visited Delhi in the backdrop of the university's grants from the UGC getting stuck. As a result, the university has been unable to pay dearness allowances, and pensions were getting delayed. However, it is making arrangements to pay DAs in view of the upcoming festival season. PU registrar Col (retired) GS Chadha said the final details of specific observations by the fact finding-committee have been submitted, and that exercise would be completed by Tuesday. ""The university is hopeful that first instalment of the central grant will be released soon to PU. The university is conscious of the employees' expectations in the festival season, and is trying hard to disburse their dues as soon as possible.

A student of science stream at Ambedkar College, Chaitanya, was overjoyed to see his marks were more than he had expected. “I was expecting a good score, no doubt, but now being told that I might be the state topper is too surreal,” said an obviously beaming Chaitanya. The reason no one can really be sure of the ‘state topper’ tag is because Maharashtra government does not release a merit list. The toppers rankings are based solely on data shared either by schools or by students/parents. Scoring high is not new to Chaitanya. He had bagged 97.8% in his SSC (Std X) too. He’s pleased that his latest feat is doing the city proud. “I was born and brought up here, so feel proud to be a Nagpurian,” he said. Unlike most of his peers, Chaitanya is not looking to go for IIT or medical field. “I want to be an economist, but want an engineering degree. So there is an interesting dual degree in engineering and economics being offered at BITS-Pilani, which I am planning to study,” said Chaitanya. He has absolutely no plans for going abroad either for studies or work. “I love my country and want to serve it. It would be great if I can join the Indian Economic Service (IES) after finishing my studies,” said Chaitanya. The IES is an inter-ministerial and inter-departmental service. The posts are primarily located in ministries/ departments dealing with economic and social sectors in the Government of India. Chaitanya comes from a humble background, one which fosters self study. “My father is a professor and mother a homemaker. They never pressured me about studies or marks, and that helped me a lot,” said Chaitanya. Last year, he lost his maternal grandfather, and that came as a jolt. “It is his blessings due to which I have achieved these marks,” he added. To de-stress, Chaitanya loves to play the keyboard. “I love listening to AR Rahman’s music, and playing a mix of classical and modern music on my keyboard,” said Chaitanya. He gives credit to his college for helping him learn techniques of approaching the exam and time management. Kabir Rawlekar, vice-principal of Ambedkar College, said “Chaitanya was kind of an all-rounder. An extremely regular student and took active part in science exhibitions too.” ","['student', 'school', 'education', 'teacher', 'class', 'college', 'university', 'admission', 'exam', 'course']",Education,candidate thronged government school city apply teaching post might fall temporarily vacant monday due ongoing strike government state school education department earlier announced government teacher drop protest lose posting replaced temporary retired staff consolidated pay state protesting teacher return work monday face disciplinary proceeding might work different school depending vacancy bear pay cut absence till sunday teacher suspended participating protest case registered unlawful public wrongful restraint deterring public servant discharge boycotted work application invited temporarily fill vacancy applied till sunday according official joint action committee tamil nadu teacher employee organization reiterated continue protest till demand indefinite strike since pressing charter including revival old pension pay par central government teacher payment month rejected claim state fishery minister jayakumar increasing pay scale toll amount spent towards welfare state school education expressed willingness hold talk resolve issue functioning school since school fully functional due high rate absenteeism among besides primary higher secondary student left though practical exam board begin next preparatory work standstill,Education,Yes,,

The Goa Pharmaceutical Manufacturer’s Association (GPMA) made a fervent plea to the state government to address these issues which it claimed would hurt the industry in the long-run if not resolved. Speaking at the GPMA function on Sunday evening, its president Suresh Kamath listed various issues which he said were hurting pharma units. He added that Goa is a preferred location for its overseas partners, but expansions plans of the units are restrained as a result of want of land. He said, Goa industrial development corporation (IDC) should intervene and release industrial plots left unutilized. He added that the pharmaceutical industry requires skilled manpower but is not able to absorb locally though the government insists on 80% employment to locals. He requested the government to increase seats at the pharmacy college so that more trained manpower is readily available. He also complained that load shedding is the biggest problem which usually happens during peak hours forcing industries make alternate arrangements. Another big problem, he said, was non-availability of adequate water supply to industries. The units have to rely on tanker water, adding to their cost of operations. He requested the government to improve the chain of water supply. He also suggested that the government improve public transport system and hostel facilities for women closer to industrial states.","['tata', 'car', 'company', 'sale', 'unit', 'steel', 'motor', 'market', 'vehicle', 'maruti']",Automobile,new japanese auto major honda announced thursday initiating one biggest car recall india nearly unit city sedan called back replacement faulty component part global carry preventive part replacement motion valve train unit generation manufactured november december company statement second recall city honda january last year recalled sedan replace defective power window switch cause india recall part global exercise company call back vehicle worldwide due faulty engine motion compressed rocker arm normal engine bend break time resulting abnormal engine noise potentially causing engine stalling problem company adding replacement carried free company communicate directly car owner covered part dealership updated replacement new part dispatched dealership phase smooth city model india affected recall involves model jazz freed compact minivan sold north latin middle east global recall impact honda jazz sold statement move come time company across globe announced call back various led toyota faced major embarrassment market accelerator problem suspected cause several fatal honda announced big recall last big car recall generally seen sign responsible popular company feel recall hit brand indian company usually open especially absence government policy honda car maker called back vehicle maruti skoda honda recalled accord,Healthcare,No,,

The number of centres in the state will be increased to 324 on Monday and the drive will cover nearly 16,200 beneficiaries.  While the state health department initially announced that 100 beneficiaries will be vaccinated at each centre, the target had to be revised due to reluctance among beneficiaries as per insiders. Meanwhile, as per official details, the number of vaccine session sites in Hyderabad will be more than doubled from 14 on the launch day to 42 on Monday, with 28 new centres. Officials want to go slow and increase the numbers of centres as they learn on the way and so that errors that took place on the first day can be avoided. “Although we have the capacity to vaccinate nearly two lakh people per day, we want to go slow on the process. With the first few rounds seeing no complications and as the beneficiaries get back to work a day after taking the vaccine, more beneficiaries will get convinced about the safety of the vaccine,” said a senior official from the state health department.

In addition to the 140 centers where the vaccine was administered on the launch day, another 184 centers were added. On Saturday, when the vaccination programme was launched in the state, a total of 3,962 beneficiaries including sanitation workers and healthcare workers were vaccinated across 140 centres in the state. The health status of the 11 beneficiaries who had reported mild side effects was enquired over phone, said the official, and all the 11 are doing fine. “They will be monitored for another two to three days,” added Dr Rao.

A fine of Rs 1 lakh was imposed for the loss of 20 trees in the area. The fine was imposed on contractor Rajashekhar Reddy for the felling of trees at Rolling Hills in Gachibowli. The felling was done to carry out underground cabling work. A case was booked by the forest department on February 10 after residents raised an issue about chopping of trees in the middle of the night. The case was booked under section 29-2(b) of TS Forest Act 1967. The weight of the wood chopped was pegged at 11.02 tonnes, costing approximately Rs 20,000. As per calculations, forest officials charged the contractor five times the amount. “Any tree felling requires permission from forest authorities concerned. Any illegal action will be taken seriously. Penalties will be imposed in case trees are chopped without permission,” said Ch Shivaiah, FDO, Shamshabad division. Forest department officials said the fine money has already been remitted. Sumanth P, general secretary, Meenakshi Towers, who first saw the trees chopped down, reacted positively. “This is a good step taken by the forest department.

The new draft pharma policy lists out a range of measures such as continuation of manufacturing of essential medicines, expenditure on R&amp;D and technology transfer to seek approval for foreign direct investment (FDI). This assumes significance as it comes after the government in June 2016 allowed up to 74% FDI in brownfield projects through automatic route, with an aim to promote investment in the sector. ""At present there is no mechanism or system to monitor the post-acquisition (FDI) activities of the company. A system would be developed to monitor the adherence to these conditions,"" the new draft policy says. The draft highlights how many neighbouring countries like Vietnam, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are emerging as generic drug manufacturers and posing competition to India. India, which is known for its ability to supply low priced quality generic medicines, is witnessing a decline in its compounded annual rate of growth in the pharmaceutical industry. It has seen a decline from 14.36% in 2010-11 to 8.68% in 2014-15. This is significant also because pharmaceutical industry is the third largest export revenue churner for India. ""The competitive advantage is being undermined through another route - the acquisition of Indian companies by foreign companies. Countries that are traditionally not strong in manufacturing formulations have started acquiring formulation-manufacturing plants/companies through automatic and government approval route,"" the draft policy document says. Officials say since manufacturing in India is cheaper and most of the facilities have state-of-the-art infrastructure, foreign firms acquire these units and then stop manufacturing drugs for use in India.
