Considered to be one of the important festivities in the annual 10-day festival, the event marked the penultimate day of the celebrations. The statue of Our Lady of Health and the Infant Jesus was carried in the chariot that was decked completely with glittering lights. The procession moved through several important streets where people greeted by falling in front of the chariot. Lakhs of people were involved in pulling the chariot that moved slowly amidst the growing crowds. The event that began with the bursting of colourful crackers that reverberated in the skies was followed by loud chores of prayers by the devotees. The car started moving at around 7.30pm and large screens were erected for the devotees at several points to witness the event. Meanwhile, senior priests of the church chanted prayers witnessing even as the chariot was taken in a procession. At least five cars were involved in the procession in which the final one was named ""Mary Matha"". A joint mass was held in the evening with the chants of lakhs of people reaching to the maximum when the cars came from the holy shrine. A similar procession was held at Vailankanni basilica in Besant Nagar in Chennai where the chariot was taken around nearby localities. The 10-day festival, which will culminate on Monday, began on August 30 with the hoisting of the flag. It was witnessed by thousands of people from across the country, who made it to the festival. Witnessing the flow of crowds, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Kumbakonam, Trichy regional division had operated 74 additional services to Kumbakonam from the district. The Southern Railway also ran at least 10 extra services for the festival. According to police officials, this year, there has been a spike in the footfalls beating the previous year's record and police have been placed across the town at several vital points including near the sea. An exclusive surveillance room with all the cameras and watch towers connected are monitored throughout the festival.","['temple', 'devotee', 'pilgrim', 'lord', 'shrine', 'priest', 'idol', 'yatra', 'rath', 'hindu']",Religion,unidentified broke temple tirunelveli decamped five idol made bronze based complaint executive officer case registered seevalaperi police inquiry alagar sundararajar burglary took located bank tamirabarani river seevalaperi according villager temple one oldest temple come hindu religious charitable trust apart old conch cash hundial stolen incident took place friday came light saturday temple priest kannan went open shocked door checking realised burglary taken place alerted temple though villager claimed three panchaloha police yet ascertain antiquity stolen police source said five three idol poodevi made bronze others soundariyalakshmi andal brass idol measured worth idol estimated cash collected hundial police strongly suspected involvement local incident already process collecting detail criminal,Religion,Yes,Correct,14

As on Tuesday, 63,283 participants registered online for the event. Participants who took part in the rehearsal were delighted with the new venue – a lush green outfield which they say is perfect to perform yoga, with the Chamundi hill as the backdrop. During the first rehearsal held in front of Mysuru Palace on June 12, nearly 2,000 participants took part, while on Sunday, nearly 20,000 took part in the rehearsal, which surprised even the organizers, who had expected around 10,000 people. For the main event on Wednesday, organizers are expecting more than 45,000 people. Those who want to take part in the event should compulsorily bring a yoga mat and can enter only after getting bar-coded tickets. All the participants will be given official Guinness attempt certificates. The district administration had earlier fixed the record-breaking attempt at Mysuru Palace, Hardinge Circle, D Devaraj Urs Road, Maharaja’s Ground, Oval Ground, and surrounding areas but since the yoga session in different places is not considered a single venue by Guinness record representatives, the district administration shifted the venue to Mysuru Race Course which can easily accommodate more than 72,000 yoga enthusiasts. Of the 139 acres, the district administration is using just 71 acres of land for the event. Certificate for participants Deputy commissioner D Randeep said, “Though the number of registrations is more than 63,000, a conservative calculation is 45,000 and are confident of surpassing the Delhi record of 38,500 people at a single venue. Though it is being conducted by the district administration, with time it has become like national event and everybody wants to be part of it, like the chain link yoga where a record number of participants took part. All the participants we will be given official Guinness attempt certificates. As a precautionary measure, we have arranged four ambulances at four different corners, with 10 doctors present at the venue.” As part of record, the whole process will have to be documented; each steward will be looking into the performance of 50 yogis; Takur Desai, general manager, Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Limited, Mysuru, and AC Lakshman, former forest secretary, will be the two independent witnesses. They will also keep count through counterfoils of tickets and videos through drone cameras. The Guinness Book of World Record officials will take 10-15 days to process it and once they are convinced, they will declare the record,” added Randeep. Ten makeshift toilets have been arranged at each of the 10 gates. Drinking water has also been arranged at prominent places. After the event, the corporation, with the help of a few NGOs, will take up a cleanliness drive at the venue. On Wednesday, seven gates will be opened from 5am to 6.45am; participants should come early and occupy their places. The event starts sharp at 7am and concludes at 7.45am. District Minister HC Mahadevappa and Union minister Sadananda Gowda will be taking part. Postal dept pushes philately as a hobby Mysuru: The postal department authorities in Mysuru want to cash in on International Yoga Day to promote stamp collection as a hobby. Last year, the postal department came out with exclusive stamps on yoga. A miniature sheet of 12 different suryanamaskaras were printed to educate the masses and promote yoga. As Mysuru is a hub of yogic activities, the postal department wants to promote the collection and study of stamps. They have organized a weeklong campaign during which employees will visit various educational institutions to promote stamp collection. Vinutha, a postal assistant in charge of the philately wing at the post office near Nehru Circle, said they will be going all out to promote stamp collection during the campaign. Miniature stamps on yoga will cost around Rs 180, she said. CR Rangaswamy, public relations inspector postal, claimed the department employees will be meeting people from all walks of life, including students, as part of a weeklong campaign. The department officials too have met yoga associations in Mysuru to promote the hobby. According to an officer, about 800 residents have philatelic accounts in Mysuru, of which 50% are active users. Account holders will get stamps of their choice from among different areas of interest like nature, birds and animals. The postal department will also come out with thematic and miniature stamps that can be delivered at their door steps. Philatelists have to regularly credit money into their account so that they get stamps regularly. tnn ","['skin', 'diet', 'food', 'yoga', 'hair', 'christmas', 'weight', 'healthy', 'fitness', 'gym']",LIfeStyle,study national centre cardiovascular revealed heart attack morning hour likely effect treatment research cardiac heart journal published research reviewed data heart attack patient treated heart attack result scarring killing heart tissue area around according heart morning episode likely associated tissue first madrid doctor connected circadian called natural pacemaker governed heart cardiologist ganesh kumar hiranandani hospital powai research shown certain blood hormone catecholamine neurotransmitter follow circadian rhythm high morning much possibly trigger heart associated adverse heart study distributed patient four group based timing morning group much higher level marker dying heart blood patient whose attack occurred evening noted according jaslok sudden cardiac death place early hour heard people going walk strenuous exercise morning suddenly getting massive heart adding people consider exercising contractor felt message one seek help tend wait entire household woken hospital get work mode pointed city doctor feel study result change cardiac hospital work early hour contributes morbidity associated heart change said doctor attached public city like mumbai kumar heart metro witnessing increase case primary minimally invasive procedure performed within six hour last mean patient reaching hospital faster getting treatment,LIfeStyle,Yes,,

SCPD decided it was not enough to get the traffic police involved. So, instead it held a sensitization workshop for parking attendants, CCP officials and the traffic police. Fifteen pay-parking attendants employed on contract basis for the CCP along with traffic police and the CCP commissioner, among others attended the program.Complaints in the past, had CCP and the traffic police passing the buck amongst each other. The traffic attendants, together with the traffic police and CCP will ensure that ten parking spaces in Panaji, which are notified for persons with disability under Section 69 of The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation), Act, 1995, are reserved exclusively for persons with disabilities. According to Section 69 of the PWD Act, anyone who fraudulently avails, or attempts to avail of any benefit meant for persons with disabilities, the person shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twenty thousand rupees or be punishable with both. President of Disability Rights Association of Goa, Avelino de Sa and other persons with disabilities shared difficulties they face while getting around in the city. Some spoke of the extra parking space they need to maneuver their vehicle, to get in and out of it and to get on to a wheelchair. “Even if people feel there are no persons with disabilities around, they cannot occupy parking spaces reserved for them. It’s a clear cut no,” says Anuradha Joshi, state commissioner for persons with disabilities. A number of cars occupying these spaces have been clamped in the past and awareness is spreading about the rights of persons with disabilities. Another sensitization workshop will be held in the first week of July for the rest of the parking attendants in Panaji, after which workshops will be arranged in Mapusa and Margao.","['parking', 'space', 'vehicle', 'footpath', 'parked', 'car', 'lot', 'park', 'mall', 'road']",Civic,mayor subramanian saturday launched automatic parking meter help regulate better parking system bus route road department chennai corporation installed experimental basis three meter north mada individual wish park vehicle insert coin ticket display vehicle cost hour two hour three entry exit time printed ticket checked parking attendant deployed wish park vehicle beyond three hour vacant slot new parked duration exceeds stipulated time mentioned vehicle towed away penalty levied parking system help away illegality committed commercial establishment exploit public road hourly parking fee regulate system certain mayor subramanian told new meter likely put end malpractice parking attendant tamil nadu corporation charge beyond prescribed rate levy six hour millenium synergy private limited install solar powered meter three area including nagar csir road plan install meter select according contractor pay corporation total collection period seven year transferring ownership right meter local welcome finally addressed local instead vehicle towed away show receipt claim slot said sankar regular visitor north mada trader made representation local body seeking allocation exclusive slot park since paucity space,Civic,Yes,Accuracy,70%

A study by the US based Kauffman Foundation shows that 33.2% of the cofounders of engineering and technology firms founded by immigrants in the US since 2006 were Indians. The next came the Chinese, at 8.1%. Another study done in 2007 for the period 1995 to 2005 had found that Indians accounted for 26% of the co-founders during that period. So there's been a 7 percentage point increase in the Indian contribution in the post-2005 period. In fact, the Indian immigrant contribution was the only one that increased; most other immigrant communities saw a decline in their contributions, leading to a general stagnation in immigrant entrepreneurship in the US. The Kauffman study examined a random sample of 1,882 companies out of a total of 107,819 engineering and technology companies founded in the last six years. Of those companies, 458 had at least one foreign-born founder. Sridhar Mitta, founder of social entrepreneurship firm NextWealth Entrepreneurs, attributes the phenomenon to the large number of smart Indian students who went to the US for higher studies and made careers there. ""Many quit their jobs to chase the big American dream of starting something of their own,"" he says. Most had mastered frugal engineering and so broke through the US glass ceiling. ""Indians are bright and very good at networking. They have a will to succeed and that makes them tick as entrepreneurs,'' says Prof S Sadagopan , director, IIIT-Bangalore . First generation entrepreneurs like Vinod Khosla became poster boys of immigrant startups. Some of them donned the avatar of mentor and investor for the immigrant community in the US. ""The IndUS Entrepreneurs broke the ice by creating an entrepreneurial culture, blurring regional differences that existed among immigrant entrepreneurs,"" says Sharad Sharma, entrepreneur in residence in venture capital firm Canaan Partners. Other successful Indianorigin entrepreneurs including Kanwal Rekhi, Pramod Haque, Gururaj Deshpande, and B V Jagadeesh won the goodwill and heart of American investors. Sabeer Bhatia, founder of Hotmail, became the face of internet ventures, drawing admiration from aspiring entrepreneurs who wanted to make it big in the dot com era. Many Indian Americans have been encouraged to launch startups knowing they can tap into the enormous amount of technology talent in India. Dhiraj Rajaram founded analytics firm Mu Sigma in Chicago, but built its entire delivery centre in Bangalore. AbsolutData, founded by Anil Kaul, Suhale Kapoor and Sudeshna Datta in California, has its delivery centre in Delhi. Fractal Analytics was founded by Nirmal Palaparthi , Pradeep Suryanarayan , Pranay Agrawal, Ramakrishna Reddy and Srikanth Velamakanni in California , with most of its delivery out of India. Mukund Mohan, CEO in residence at the Microsoft Startup Accelerator, says Indians working in the technology space gave many immigrant entrepreneurs a head start into tech ventures. ""The Bay Area has only six million people of which half a million are Indians. And of those Indians, 72% work in the tech sector. Of the total tech firms that get funded in the US, 50% are in Silicon Valley. So the chances of Indians becoming founders or co-founders of these companies is high,"" he says.(With inputs from Mini Joseph Tejaswi) ","['company', 'brand', 'product', 'business', 'talent', 'ceo', 'market', 'growth', 'retail', 'global']",Businness,fund sixth sense along badminton star saina invested million soothe feminine hygiene healthcare platform manufacture sanitary napkin brand first investment along sixth fund founded former idfc security nikhil hold minority stake bollywood cricket star cut deal startup company founded sahil dharia quitting global head research thomson reuters previously worked various role ubs investment bank enterprise new soothe healthcare set manufacturing unit according sanitary pad market india expected grow crore crore next seven eight million menstruating woman india currently penetration sanitary pad believe opportunity dharia although dharia declined comment funding said company capital marketing distribution pilot pune kochi market response already walmart itc planning grow distributed network said adding company soon launching major growing interest towards consumer product company among private equity fund venture capital gift merchandise raised million matrix sixth sense venture invested retail chain luxury jhs oral care product,Businness,Yes,,

And, today, it is helping Pune elders ���grow young', and become fit, happy and free of stress.For 49-year-old businessman Chandrashekhar Khapre, dance is the best form of meditation. Having lost his wife, Manisha, to cancer last year, Khapre has been learning to cope with his loss through dance. ""Even when my wife was undergoing chemotherapy, she would encourage me to attend the class and not miss out on what was happening in terms of my dance lessons,"" he says. Khapre adds that though he started learning dance as a way to deal with stress and get a couple of hours of peace, today, he genuinely loves dancing and intends to continue with it.His teacher, Rocky Poonawala praises his 49-year-old student effusively. ""He is a very good. You should see him dance in class. He is one of the oldest, but does not look his age,"" he laughs. Explaining why the older generation is looking at dance extensively, Poonawala says, ""Personally, I feel that a lot of them have missed out on learning different dance styles that we now have. Also, it helps them deal with stress.""Dance instructor Hrishikesh Pawar says he has even had 62-year-old students. ""I feel that dance not only helps you deal with stress, but it also helps you keep fit. Today, everyone wants to look beautiful and young, even when they are 50. Dance is a good way to help them get there,"" he smiles. But Pawar also has a word of caution. He says that older people should stick to free style dancing and not take up a particular dance style, which often involves tricky movements.Dance instructor Vibhav Singh echoes Pawar's thoughts. He says that he advises his students above 40 to take up Bollywood dancing or to explore Latin American dance styles. ""People's bones are not very strong at that age, and so it is better to learn these styles. Some individuals come to me to learn dance as a way of fitness, while others come because they could not learn these styles when they were young,"" says Singh.One of Singh's students, Asharani Rath (45), a guest faculty at a city institute, says that dancing makes her happy. ""I used to dance when I was a child, but I stopped once I got married since I became busy with my husband and children. Now, that my children have grown up, I decided to return to dancing. And I'm glad I did so,"" she says. She adds that not only does this keep her fit, but it is also a good source of entertainment. ""I have learnt Rumba, Cha Cha Cha and even Bollywood dancing."" For businessman Bonny Uppal and his wife Seema, learning to dance helps them keep up with the learning process of life. ""Both of us enjoy dancing and the best part is that its stimulates not just the body, but also the mind. We have learnt different styles, including Latin American, and for us now it has become our personal wellness programme,"" laughs Bonny.Poonawala who says that a quarter of his class is over the age of 40 feels it is also the challenge of learning something new that brings them here. ""They want to learn something new and deal with stress at the same time, what better than dancing?"" he smiles.","['music', 'song', 'singer', 'dance', 'classical', 'album', 'singing', 'band', 'audience', 'musical']",Entertainment,hemant attempt break world record singing continuously three hemant selected song sung popular singer made list song total runtime eight plan sing popular song kishore talat mohammad sonu suresh wadkar music enthusiast city thoroughly entertained hear burbure said medical team present deal emergency arising marathon chandak head life support system said brain cell fatigued chance hemant might enter going give sort stimulant keep taken tremendous challenge prove support ensure everything,Entertainment,Yes,,

Pinarayi Vijayan is expected to deliver a talk on communal harmony at the rally. Meanwhile, Vishwa Hindu Parishat (VHP) and Hindu Jagarana Vedike leaders on Monday requested like-minded people to support the hartal voluntarily to oppose the visit of Kerala CM to Mangaluru. “The CPM has been trying to play with the sentiments of people of Dakshina Kannada district by inviting Pinarayi Vijayan, who heads a political party that is responsible for killing of hundreds on ideological lines in Kerala. Hence, we have given a call to observe a hartal in Dakshina Kannada district on February 25 opposing the visit of Pinarayi Vijayan, who is encouraging political killings,” M B Puranik, regional working president of VHP, told reporters. Releasing a list of BJP, RSS and other Hindu leaders, who are said to have been killed in the home district (Kannur) of Pinarayi Vijayan, VHP leader said the CPM is trying to suppress voice of its opponents through murders and violence. “We express our deep concern over public rally on ‘communal harmony’ to be addressed by Pinarayi Vijayan. It is ironic that such a public programme on communal harmony will be attended by a person, who is from a political party whose hands are stained with blood of hundreds of innocent Indians. Dharamadom, the constituency of of Pinarayi Vijayan in Kannur district of Kerala, is witness to huge number of political murders. The CPM, which has a strong base in this district, has been successful in peddling violence in the name of protection of the minority. Hence, we are calling for a hartal on February 25 in protest,” Puranik said and added that a memorandum has been given to the district administration seeking ban on Pinarayi Vijayan’s address in Dakshina Kannada district. “We have appealed the district administration that Pinarayi Vijayan not only be restricted from addressing the public in the district of Dakshina Kannada, but also be barred from making public appearances,” Puranik said.

Bankers said that lending rates have peaked and they may not go up further. That holds true for deposit rates too. “I am not expecting either lending or deposit rates to move up from here. They are going to remain benign, depending on the situation of inflation,” Mohan Tanksale, executive director of Punjab National Bank, said. M Narendra, chairman and managing director of Indian Overseas Bank, said that some small banks, who have not been able to fully pass on the increase in their cost of fund, may go for a further 0.25% increase in their lending rates. “However, interest rates in general are going to remain stable in the first quarter of 2011-12.” S C Sinha, executive director of Oriental Bank of Commerce, said deposit and lending rates are going to fall from here on. The bankers’ opinion is based on the expectation that inflation rate will come down further. They are also expecting the liquidity situation to improve in the coming days. “We have seen that the inflation rate is coming down because of the combine effort of the RBI and the government. We are expecting inflation to come down further to 7%. The government also has started spending, which would ease the pressure on liquidity. Thus we may see only one or two small steps from the RBI,” said Narendra. United Bank of India’s executive director S C Bansal said that the RBI may increase its policy rates by another 0.25%. He, however, said that the hike will not have any further impact on the interest rates. “There are two reasons why interest rates may not go up further. Banks are comfortable with the liquidity, where it stands now. Second, the first quarter of a financial year is usually sluggish in terms of credit demand. Thus, there is no pressure on banks to raise lending and deposit rates,” Bansal said. According to the Reserve Bank’s latest data, banks have seen a 23.3% growth in their credit in FY11, compare to a 16.2% in FY10. The demand for deposit grew only by 16.6% as against 18.8% the previous year. Banks are expecting things to change. They are pegging deposit growth at 20%+ in the current financial year.

The Bihar capital continues to be a strong base for SIMI activists. Ziauddin may be one of the isolated members of the banned outfit to be arrested recently, but two years back the police had identified two hardcore members and brain behind SIMI operations — Hasib Raza and Ghulam Sarwar Falahi.Intelligence sources said soon after the Centre announced a ban on SIMI in 2002, the state government simply issued directives to all DMs and SPs to ascertain the activities of the organisation in their respective districts and, in the event of any suspicion, keep it posted besides taking follow-up action.The state police had then picked up only three members — Sakhawat Ullah, Reyazul Mushahid and Mohd Riyauddin — considered 'lesser evils' of SIMI while they were staging a protest near the Tumtum Parao in Phulwarisharif. In that incident, both Hasib Raza and Ghulam Sarwar Falahi managed to slip away. The whereabouts of these two hardcore SIMI members are still not known to security agencies involved in anti-terrorist operations across the country.Sources maintained that Raza, who has been a SIMI member since its inception in Bihar in 1990, was one of the hardcore members of the dreaded terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen. This besides, Central intelligence sources indicated that Raza also figured in the Mumbai blasts case.He rose from the ranks to became president of Bihar unit of SIMI. Similarly, Falahi was a former president of SIMI’s state unit and had even organised a function at the Anjuman Islamia Hall here following the ban to spit venom against the Centre’s decision to ban the outfit.Both Raza and Falahi were later made 'advisors' of SIMI as they had crossed the age limit of 30 years.

Dineshkumar Chauhan, who was also fined Rs50,000, was posted at the air cargo complex of the city’s international airport in 2015, when he was booked. The court held that the Rs 19.5 lakh will have to be forfeited to the state. CBI had alleged that Chauhan accumulated assets worth Rs 45 lakh between January 1, 2007 and June 21, 2012. It said his total income during the check period was only Rs 28 lakh. The investigating agency said Chauhan did not have a “satisfactory explanation” about excess assets. The prosecution examined 17 witnesses. Chauhan denied the allegations and said calculations by the investigation officer were incorrect. The court calculated the illgotten sum to be only Rs 19.5 lakh, which included around Rs 5 lakh seized from Chauhan’s Ghatkopar house. The court denied his defence that the money belonged to his wife and was given to her by her father and since she did not have a bank account in the city, it was kept at home. The court said the woman had bank accounts across the country and obviously knew how to open one in the city. “Apart from this, the amount was found in 11 envelopes, which appears strange, abnormal and unusual,” the court said. But the court did not accept the prosecution’s claim that the Rs 15 lakh seized from Chauhan’s family home in Delhi belonged to him. The defence had said that the money belonged to his brother and sister-in-law, a cable operator and make-up artist respectively. Chauhan had joined as drug inspector in Central Drug Standard Control Organization, Ministry of Health, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) in 1998, and was posted across the country during his career.

Venturing into the Indian heartland and telling stories that are relatable is resonating more with cinegoers. The company Soham Rockstar, led by known distributors-exhibitors Kamal Mukut and Deepak Mukut, takes pride in bringing engaging and indentifiable stories to the screens.
The father-son duo, who had previously backed the romantic drama 'Sanam Teri Kasam' and have the awaited Rajkummar Rao-Kriti Kharbanda romcom 'Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana', state, “While we’ve always believed in telling stories, we have been fortunate enough to work with like-minded directors and actors. It’s important for us to work together and not have different agendas, because eventually that’s what shows on the big screen. A film made with the heart will always shine through.” 

 
 
Interestingly, the production house’s slate for the coming months boasts of subjects of diverse genres -- like Anubhav Sinha-directed 'Mulk', a courtroom drama starring Rishi Kapoor and Taapsee Pannu, 'Gadar : Ek Prem Katha' director Anil Sharma’s launchpad for his son Utkarsh Sharma titled 'Genius' that also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and is scheduled to release May 2018. Later, they also have Anil Sharma’s 'Kavach' with Sunny Deol, scheduled to release next December.
The production house has also lined up a sequel to the 2001 hit 'Nayak', to be penned by KV Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote the 'Bahubali' series and 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Not to forget, director Sidharth Anand is making Faisal Ali’s biopic for the Mukuts who are looking to release it next Diwali. That’s not all, the production house is also recreating classics like 'Bees Saal Baad' (1962), 'Jhootha Kahin Ka' (1979) and 'Chameli Ki Shaadi' (1986).
Talking about their extensive line-up, Deepak sums up saying, “Our effort has always been to back good content. We are lucky that the audiences are now appreciating this more and we have an opportunity to tell more stories.”

While thousands of Maharashtrians across the world will chew neem leaves (part of a prasad) to welcome the New Year, 5,000 farmers across three districts in Vidarbha will pay obeisance to the Neem tree which has also played a key role in curbing the suicide rate. The Neem Foundation, in collaboration with the Union ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, has been engaged in a fight against the tragic suicide cases of farmers in Vidarbha by training them to make their own pesticides and fertilisers from a Neem tree.""We have covered nearly 3,000 villages and also taught farmers organic farming using neem inputs combined with earth-friendly technologies like vermiculture,"" said Pramila Thakkar, managing trustee, Neem Foundation. ""We are reaching out personally to the farmers in Nagpur, Wardha and Yavatmal districts and want to reach out to thousands of others in coming months.""Thakkar said that several farmers were initially reluctant to buy the ""Neem"" theory. ""We did not force them, but requested them to allot a portion of their farmland for using Neem as a pesticide and fertiliser. It worked wonders and now, several more farmers are joining the fray,"" she stated.In fact, what has encouraged them more are the cash rewards instituted by the foundation for the best village and best farmer using the technique for optimum harvest? ""We have a cash award of Rs 1 lakh distributed in four categories,"" she said. The Foundation has also set up the Neem Research and Technology Development Centre in Gondkhairi village, a tiny hamlet situated 20 kilometres away from Nagpur. The centre is a single window facility for Neem technologies for farmers, researchers and entrepreneurs. The technical training offered by the centre is for neem processing and storage, and seed collection.Thakkar said that many farmers have given her in writing the benefits of Neem for better farming. ""Besides, our programme is directly supported by the government of India. At the moment, we are also looking at working in tandem with corporates who can adopt villages. We can provide the necessary training and expertise,"" she added. Another official from the Foundation said, ""Azadirachtin, the most important insecticidal substance contained in Neem seeds, has a growth disrupting effect on many insect larvae. Also, other pests like grasshoppers avoid or reduce feeding as a reaction to Azadirachtin.As tests have repeatedly confirmed, due to its special mode of action, the neem extract is quite harmless for useful insects. And, one great advantage of the neem extract is that even after repeated application on vegetable crops, it remains perfectly harmless for humans.""Growing Neem trees help ameliorate the soil and minimises pollution levels. Planting neem on a large-scale can provide a long term solution for sustainable ecosystem, check against global warming, improve ecology of the local habitat and restore the fauna.","['farmer', 'crop', 'sugar', 'agriculture', 'sugarcane', 'paddy', 'tonne', 'mango', 'hectare', 'agricultural']",Agriculture,bihar sugar mill association urged state government give sugar miller minimum subsidy per quintal cane crushing season tide loss caused due dip sugar price bsma secretary naresh bhatt said thursday sale price sugar fallen per quintal putting bihar sugar miller loss per quintal total crore loss cane crushed proved surplus sale price sugar expected fall coming urged state government give subsidy minimum rate per help sugar miller meet financial loss cane crushing state stood lakh sugar recovery rate cane state expected sugar production lakh approximate cost sugar production state per expected loss miller per quintal crore introduction good service tax sugar state government getting revenue crore sugar bhatt bsma requested state government early payment crore sugar mill help clearing balance cane price payment cane,Agriculture,Yes,,

However, Nagpur University officials are opposing the proposed road. As per NMC's plan, traffic in Sitabuldi area, especially from Variety Square to Munje square, and from Variety Square to Morris College T-point, needs to be eased. All vehicles coming from Amravati Road and heading towards either Cotton Market or Morris College T-point presently go via Variety square. Traffic from Wardha Road and from Sitabuldi market too comes to Variety square. Similarly, MSRTC buses too come from Loha Pul to Morris College T-point and pass Variety Square to go on to Amravati road. Also, during the winter session at Vidhan Bhavan, the roads adjoining the legislature are blocked. The citizens have to take long detours in this area. Considering all these problems, NMC has chalked out a plan to construct a road that will begin from Morris College T-point, where a gate can be seen at present, and go through the premises of Vasantrao Naik Institute of Arts and Social Sciences. A kaccha road is in place from the gate to the nullah at present. From here, a nine-meter wide tar road passes through the old Air Force canteen and joins Rabindranath Tagore Marg between the gates of Nagpur University and Institute of Science on Rabindranath Tagore road, from Maharajbagh square to WCL Rest House square and on to Akashwani square. The plan is to widen the road to 18 meters in width. The construction of the road will come at the cost of a compound wall and some land belonging to Nagpur University, Institute of Science, BSNL, Mure Memorial Hospital and Veterinary Polyclinic. It will not require the demolition of any structures or buildings. NMC official from PWD (projects) told TOI the proposed 18 meter wide road is sanctioned in the Development Plan (DP) of the city. Therefore, a meeting was held with officials of the institutions to be affected on February 21. Later, NMC sent a proposal on February 24, requesting the district administration to acquire the land and transfer it to NMC. The district administration has started the process to acquire the land by sending notices to the affected institutions. The standing committee of NMC has in a meeting on January 2 approved Rs 6.03 crore for the construction of the road, including a 24 metre long bridge spanning the nullah. A project management consultant had also been appointed for execution of the road project, said the official. A senior official from NMC said the road will benefit citizens. ""Project will be undertaken as sanctioned in DP. During the sanctioning of the road in DP, suggestions and objections of affected institutions had been invited. Since the road was sanctioned in the DP there would be no objections. The gazette notification of the DP was published on September 10, 2001. Therefore, the road will definitely come up,"" he said. Confirming the developments, registrar Mahesh Yenkie said Nagpur University will not provide its land for the road. ""The decision was taken in a meeting held some days back. The building of Academic Cell is located just along the proposed road and may face threat of demolition. We have sent a reply to the notice informing NMC about our decision,"" he told TOI. A senior NMC official said the university as well as Institute of Science belong to the state government. ""NMC will take up the issue with the government to get the land for its proposed road,"" he said.NOTEPROPOSED ROAD: From Morris College T-point to Rabindranath Tagore Marg.

Tamil Nadu registered its protest with Kerala.  In a letter, Tamil Nadu chief secretary Mohan Verghese Chunkath lodged the protest with his Kerala counterpart, Nivedita P Haran, additional chief secretary, against the visit of the MLA, without intimating Tamil Nadu water resources department and taking mediapersons with him and also the Kerala police's failure to prevent the unauthorized entry. This went against the undertaking given by Kerala to the Supreme Court about guarding the dam and the appurtenant structures.  Meanwhile, with Tamil Nadu remaining firm in keeping water level in Mullaperiyar dam at 142 feet, Kerala is now considering sending an all-party delegation to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and seek his intervention in the issue. Minister for water resources P J Joseph said on Monday he would discuss with Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy and other cabinet colleagues about requesting the PM to persuade Tamil Nadu to reduce the water level. Sources said the much-awaited meeting of the SC-appointed supervisory committee to restore the full storage level will meet at the dam site on November 24.  In his letter, Chunkath said Mullaperiyar being a sensitive and restricted area, the visit without prior permission was highly condemnable. Kerala police on the dam site was also non-cooperative and did not prevent the unauthorized entry.  ""Tamil Nadu government reiterates that entry into the restricted area is prohibited and Kerala government will be squarely responsible for any damage caused to the dam and its appurtenant structures,"" the chief secretary said.  Tamil Nadu alleged that when they arrived at the main dam, mediapersons pushed aside the executive engineer, water resources department and proceeded to the Baby dam. ""Inspite of the TN officer requesting protection, the Kerala police were mute spectators,"" the chief secretary said.  In 2011, Tamil Nadu moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Centre to depute CISF at the dam site. During the proceedings, Kerala gave an undertaking that police and forest officials have been strictly instructed to give adequate protection.  ""If stern corrective action is not taken by the Kerala government immediately, Tamil Nadu will have to approach the Supreme Court seeking appropriate legal remedy, and also seek deployment of the Central Industrial Security Force to guard the dam,"" Chunkath said.
