The delay has sparked concern among industrialists at Verna Industrial estate who fear that failure to complete the project before the monsoons could create unnecessary inconvenience for movement of raw material, finished products and commuters along the stretch. Highlighting the problem, Verna Industries Association (VIA) has urged the state government to provide additional funds to facilitate the shifting of underground utility services. “The cost to shift utilities is not included in the tender, which the Centre floated,” VIA president Damodar Kochkar said. “It is understood that they have provision of only Rs 15 lakh as against Rs 1.25 crore required only to shift overhead electrical lines.” The NH 17-B link connects NH 17-B with NH 4 and passes through the Verna Industrial Estate and Loutolim. PWD has taken up the ambitious project as it aims to reduce the distance and time taken to travel between Mormugao and Belagavi via Ponda. The VIA has raised its concerns with the BJP-led state government and has also taken up the matter with the relevant ministries. “In spite of constant representation, nothing has been done about this. These underground utilities have been kept as it is below the road, but now the contractor cannot go ahead with work as the overhead electrical lines and installation are also not shifted,” Kochkar said. “Most of the work is on, but, yes, there are minor issues in shifting of some cables,” said principal chief engineer of PWD Utam Parsekar. “We are working on them.” VIA, which has held several meetings with PWD, insists that the state government has failed to understand the plight of the commuters and the industry. To make matters worse, says Kochkar, the election procedure has paralysed the functioning of the industries. “All electricity sub-station officers have been assigned to election duty. If the decision is not taken soon then the road work will not get completed before monsoon and Verna industries will face hardships,” said Kochkar.

A division bench comprising Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the interim reprieve to private educational institutions, on a plea moved by All India Private Educational Institutions Association assailing the amendment dated January 25. According to the petitioner, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act and the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act provided exemption from payment of property tax to educational institutions in the state. The state government brought in certain amendments to these Acts to remove the exemption provided to the institutions and empowering the authorities to levy property tax for the properties owned by the institutions. After the amendment, only government run educational institutions would get the exemption, the petitioner said. The move was immediately challenged by the association in the high court. The high court dismissed the plea holding that the government has power to cancel exemption granted to educational institutions. Subsequently, the association approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court order. While the appeal is pending before the apex court, the state levied property taxes on the institutions based on the amendments and demand notices were issued to the institutions for payment of tax.

And this time he earned laurels for Hafiznagar in Bamunimaidam for being the first person to clear the High School Leaving Certificate (HSLC) examination from the area.  “It feels great when the spotlight is on you and your hard work is appreciated by one and all. I would like to thank my mother for enduring so much pain to help me continue my studies,” said Sujab, whose father is a ragpicker, from a corner in his hut where his mother runs a tea stall.  In the recently declared results, Sujab secured over 50% marks and has been admitted into the city’s Kamrup Academy. He took the Class X examination from Bhaskar Bidyapeeth High School.  Sheer hard work and determination ensured his success. He even worked as a labourer at construction sites and as a help in houses during the night to buy books and clothes for him and his siblings.  “I earn over Rs 300 a day and spend the money to buy my books and clothes for my siblings,” Sujab said.  He wanted to study science but his family could not afford it. “I wish I could become a software engineer, it is my dream. But I’m not sure if that would ever happen,” he added. His father, Chandmiya Ali, said it had become difficult for him to run the family with increasing prices of essential commodities. “Who does not want his son to excel and become a better person? But for us, survival comes first then education. I also have to look after my other children. If somebody helps my son, I believe he will do good in life,” Ali said.  Sujab, now, wants to promote education in his neighbourhood and wants the other children in the slum to study and be the agents of change.  Sujab has become an inspiration for all those children living in the slum areas of Guwahati who have to struggle for existence and still have the fire to come out victorious in their fights for a better life, said Miguel Das Queah, a child rights activist.

According to the initial plan, Rs 85 lakh was set aside for the swimming pool and Rs 2 crore for the indoor stadium. But construction work began in 2008. What went wrong is that the authorities began constructing a 21/25 metre swimming pool at a revised estimate of Rs 1.65 crore. Elected representatives gave their assurance for providing the required additional funds for the construction of the stadium from the state youth service and sports department. But the decision to construct the pool and the assurance of extra funds has halted the construction of stadium. The state government has not released its share of Rs 1 crore and this has only delayed the work. Apart from the Rs 70 lakh that has been spent on the stadium another Rs 60 lakh is required. Sport lovers have demanded of the two ministers C M Udasi and Basavaraj Bommai, who hail from the district, that the required funds be released to see to the completion of the stadium.

""We have spoken to the authorities concerned and asked them to address the issue immediately,"" said a DAMEPL spokesman.  The airport authorities, specifically DIAL, had been asked to look into the matter.

Sources said the concessionaire has been asked to provide an elevated section to CISF, from where screening can be done without being subject to the vagaries of the weather as had happened on Sunday.  Incidentally, Metro stations are designed to have drainage systems in place, which can manage excess water. Underground stations are particularly susceptible because of the depth and presence of underground cables for electronic and signalling functions. Last year, too, water had seeped in at the airport Metro station but it hadn't affected passengers operations. ""The heavy rain was unexpected this year.

APCCF &amp; state nodal officer Sanjeev Gaur on December 19, 2019, had invited attention of PCCF (HoFF) and chairman of SLC, raising serious objection on the minutes of the SLC meeting held on November 18, 2019. The copy of the letter has been sent to the state government, which has constituted the committee as well as the regional office of the MoEFCC, which happens to be the appellate authority against the decisions of the SLC. According to Gaur the decision taken by the SLC on November 18 to grant more such licences instead of reviewing the 50 licences issued earlier is nothing but afterthought on the part of the then PCCF (HoFF) to defend his report to issue licenses, which has already been rejected by the government. On November 18, SLC, under the chairmanship of UK Agrawal, the then PCCF, took a controversial decision to look afresh into matters of applications of additional cutting machines instead of reviewing 50 AHBS issued on July 23, 2018. Gaur also contended that the decision to grant 50 licences on July 23 was without prescribed quorum. It was Gaur, who as CCF (territorial), Nagpur, and the member of SLC then, played a whistle-blower and pointed out that the SLC decision was against Supreme Court directives. Based on Gaur’s report, the state government has objected to the SLC decision to grant 50 AHBS licences in Kolhapur circle. Gaur contended that in the nine-member SLC meeting on November 18, barring the chairman himself and representative of the saw mill owners, all others were new. The regional office of MoEFCC at Nagpur has already informed PCCF (HoFF) to take necessary action in conformity with Supreme Court order of March 4, 1997 regarding licences granted to 50 applicants for operation of 42-inch AHBS on November 15, 2019. Gaur also mentioned that the decisions in the meeting held on November 18 tantamount to brushing aside facts and statutory provisions of MFR 2014. Surprisingly, minutes of the meeting held on November 18 do not bear signature of MoEFCC representative Suresh Kumar Adapa, raising doubts whether SLC decision was in conformity with government of India guidelines. Gaur also urged present PCCF (HoFF) N Rambabu that entire issue may again be placed before the SLC in a fair and impartial manner without any external influence. Rambabu has already told TOI that he shall be taking appropriate action, both as chairman of SLC and technical adviser to the government. “Now it is up to him to save the government from embarrassment,” said sources. As reported by TOI, permission for 50 band saws has been granted without receiving timber assessment report from Institute of Wood Science &amp; Technology (IWST), Bengaluru &amp; Indian Council of Forestry Research &amp; Education (ICFRE), Dehradun. Besides, as per state government, giving permission for installation of additional band saws amounts to increasing cutting capacity of a saw mill and is against SC decision. “A plain reading of the minutes of November 18, 2019, meeting makes it clear that the entire story is hatched and there is an attempt to cover up the actions of then PCCF, who, by his position as chairman of SLC, must have prevailed over other members,” Gaur’s objection letter states. CCF (protection) and member-secretary of the SLC SS Dahiwale confirmed that APCCF Gaur has raised objections against the minutes of the meeting of SLC held on November 18.

In Delhi Jal Board's first meeting on Thursday, after the new AAP government took charge, a 10% hike is likely to be proposed. A final decision on implementing or deferring it will be taken in the meeting.  During the previous Congress regime, a proposal was passed by the Board to implement a 10% increase in water tariffs on January 1 each year. This hike has only taken place twice. During the two election years it was deferred, while one year the hike did not take place as DJB was facing problems with its revenue system.  The other major decision on the cards is the formal taking over of water supply to Dwarka from DDA. While the transfer has taken place, the Board meeting will formally allow the water tariff in Dwarka to be brought down to the rates charged elsewhere in Delhi. The sub-city has till now being paying more than double the rates to DDA even though water supply to the area has been woefully short. The relief to residents may be given from April 1.  ""The tariff hike is likely to see fireworks with BJP expected to oppose it tooth and nail. However, the department needs funds, especially after the new government allowed free lifeline water to residents and no hike has taken place this year. However, the government may not allow a 10% automatic hike each year and will regulate tariffs based on the water utility's financial condition,"" said sources.

The prohibitory orders come into force with immediate effect to ensure that people do not crowd around water bodies. The order will be applicable till November 11, post-Diwali. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare, who issued the orders for water bodies located in the rural areas of Nashik, said, “There are multiple reasons for issuing such orders. While that includes safety of people, who generally go to water bodies for Ganesh visarjan and other purposes, another important aspect is that of the Covid-19 situation.” With Covid restrictions in place in city areas, people are likely to travel to various water bodies, including Gangapur Dam, Gautami Godavari, Kashyapi, Alandee, Darna, Mukne, Bhavli, Valdevi, Kadva, Nandurmadhmeshwar, Bhojapur, spread across talukas like Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Niphad, Dindori, etc. The administration has, therefore, warned people against visiting such places for Ganesh immersions. The other reason includes the safety of people as well as water bodies and dams. Asked if such orders would be detrimental for tourism and other activities near water bodies, Mandhare said, “The orders were related to open places. There are restrictions in place for resorts and boat clubs and the responsibility of guest safety on the premises is underlined.” ","['water', 'supply', 'dam', 'drinking', 'pipeline', 'tanker', 'reservoir', 'river', 'area', 'irrigation']",WaterResources,public health engineering department found quality water water collected phed line various part city failed clear quality standard human consumption test conducted time india suresh gyan vihar organization related water conservation safe drinking water feel report indicates official apathy towards basic public area covered toi report satisfactory water past year incessant exploitation ground water along increase level water supplied city rajendra activist jaldhara ngo involved clean water issue worsened following deliberate ignorance phed sanganer water water still supplied explains quality water water sample collected toi failed one six crucial parameter safe drinking fluoride level found exceptionally phed official found water scenario city testing facility study water sample across situation unfair label water unfit senior phed official said department minister principal secretary visit department unable though department invited toi present test maintained test conducted showed major anomaly water response phed official expected reportedly filed complaint chief medical health officer distributing pamphlet warning resident ambabari possibility disease areathe absence actual comprehensive water policy another cause difficulty faced state government policy deal water exploitation ground water tube well unrestrained quality water availability future maindola lok sampati sanrakshan samiti allowing including big industrialist property owner privilege draw ground government hesitant formulate maindola department official confess situation state alarming prompt action required avoid grave consequence properly regulate treat water factor like justified charge water strict water policy addressed phed official,Healthcare,No,,

 The guest of honour for the event was noted Marathi film actor Atul Kulkarni. Forty alumni who had completed their post graduate diplomas in specialisations like journalism, radio, film, television and communication studies this year were present for the occasion.
 
 The event started off with a welcome speech given by the institute’s Director, Asmita Dani. Then, a special inaugural dance, Ganesh Vandana, was presented by the students of ISC as a welcome gesture to their seniors. Speaking on the occasion, Atul Kulkarni said, “Degrees and diplomas are merely papers if not put to practical use. One has to be a keen learner and compete with oneself.” The ISC students also put up an impressive audio visual presentation which the actor enjoyed thoroughly.
 
 Addressing the students, Tarita Shankar, Chairperson of the Indira Group of Institutes, said, “Students and young professionals must learn to give and share. Giving is a powerful activity that adds a new dimension to a personality and we gain a lot from sharing.

The water body, which was spread over 57 acres in 1914, shrunk by about 10 acres due to encroachments in 1960. The civic body now says the encroachment was to protect the properties of some vested interests in and around the tank. This had led to water overflowing into the adjoining residential area during moonsoon until the civic body took up renovation works, says BCC chief executive engineer Gopalswamy. The civic body has now urged the department of civil engineering at the Indian Insititute of Science to provide a design to increase the storage level in the tank. It is also looking at the old design with suitable modifications for the purpose. ""By doing this,we can increase the storage capacity by at least six feet. Once the tank gets full, the excess water will be let into the storm water drain"", Gopalswamy added. He brushed aside complaints from residents that the tank overflowed as poor construction materials were used in the renovation work. ""There is no chance of overflow. A wall collapsed three months ago afte a stone-laden truck hit the wall causing it to break. We did not carry out renovations after that as we are waiting for the blueprint from IISc"", he said. The tank has been renovated at a cost of Rs 3.6 crore and a lot of facilities including kalyanis, drains, silting facilities and toilets had been provided, he said. But residents disagree on the issue of the tank overflowing. ""We saw the water overflow and submerge even the footpath but the corporation claims otherwise"", said a resident of Vyalikaval.","['flood', 'disaster', 'rain', 'heavy', 'water', 'district', 'cyclone', 'river', 'relief', 'rainfall']",Disaster,heavy rain lashed salem district night till friday damaging tree following intense rescue team consisting revenue department tamil nadu fire rescue service personnel police official formed clear debris wooden area salem city recorded water level height two foot main traffic halted yercaud salem tree got uprooted ghat several resident complained sewage water mixed rainwater overflowed drainage channel almost across water stagnation cherry brindhavan road gandhi road caused inconvenience rainwater entered narrow street flooded house ammapet shevapet area dharmapuri krishnagiri district experienced intense shower beginning thursday village burgur shoolagiri recorded heavy,WaterResources,No,,

The meeting will be held on March 13 in New Delhi at the union ministry of urban development (MoUD). Managing director Brajesh Dixit told TOI that the meeting was being held in the national capital because of the ongoing parliament session. “The board members representing central government can’t leave New Delhi so the plan to hold the meet at Nagpur has to be dropped,” he explained.  Although NMRCL was registered under Company’s Act last month, it can’t function fully until the first board meeting takes place. “The agenda is a long one and has forty points. Twenty-five of them are related to statutory provisions under company laws,” Dixit said.  The main issues to be discussed are how to run the company, selection process of appointment of directors, powers of board members and directors, etc. “Initially, we will appoint three directors. Later, two more will be appointed. They will look after operation and maintenance of the metro rail so there is no role for them at present,” the MD said.  The meeting is very important for the next step of NMRCL, which is to appoint the interim consultant. This consultant, a public sector undertaking (PSU), will design the rail’s priority stretch from airport to Khapri. NMRCL hopes to start construction of this stretch by May.  Simultaneously, it will prepare the global tender document for appointment of the general consultant, which will design the remaining stretches of the rail.  The tender for general consultant’s appointment will have to be floated within two months of the appointment of interim consultant and it will have to be finalized within six months.  Another important milestone in progress of the metro is the visit of team of French development agency AFD, which has promised to lend Rs1,500 crore for the project, on March 26, 27 and 28.
