The state government has now decided to come out with an action plan to support all such children who lost their parents to the novel coronavirus. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led state cabinet meeting on Sunday constituted a cabinet sub-committee to collect details and assess problems being faced by such orphans as well as orphanages in Telangana. Women and child welfare minister Satyavathi Rathod will head the cabinet sub-committee comprising 10 other ministers including T Harish Rao, KT Rama Rao, Sabitha Indra Reddy, V Srinivas Goud, Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Koppula Eshwar, Gangula Kamalakar, Indrakaran Reddy, G Jagadish Reddy and Errabelli Dayakar Rao. The cabinet directed the medical and health secretary to get comprehensive information on affected children. All collectors have been told to submit details of orphans and orphanages from their respective districts to the medical and health secretary. The cabinet, which also discussed the Covid situation in Telangana and other states, decided to focus on districts with higher cases. The cabinet directed officials to increase the number of tests to identify coronavirus patients, intensify vaccination drive, improve medical infrastructure, medicine supplies and ensure there was no shortage of oxygen facilities in hospitals in all the districts. It was also decided to ensure that the seven new medical colleges sanctioned would start functioning from the ensuing academic year. Officials were told to take up steps for construction of hospital, hostel and college buildings, labs, beds and other essential facilities to be put in place. Also, officials were told to identify land for new medical colleges that are expected to be sanctioned in future. The medical and health department officials have been told to prepare an action plan and submit it to the chief minister at the earliest. The chief minister said there is a possibility of orphaned children being deserted and subjected to social discrimination resulting in psychological problems. “Until they grow up and are able to financially sustain themselves, the government will support them,” KCR said. In the past, the orphans were given BC status and steps were taken for their safety. The government offices which are lying empty and are suitable, would be transformed into rehabilitation homes for the orphans. The committee will make field visits as part of its state-wide tour and prepare comprehensive guidelines for the development of orphans. State planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar would be special invitee to the committee meetings.

A division bench of Chief Justice Ajit Prakash Shah and Justice Manmohan reserved their order for August 25 after hearing the arguments from the Airports Authority of India, Delhi International Authority Limited (DIAL) and Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL). DIAL counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi submitted before the bench: ""The fee is an inter-generational fee and is being charged from passengers keeping in mind the future prospects.'' On Wednesday, Solicitor General Gopal Subrahmaniam, appearing for the government, submitted that ""development of airports is a private initiative and therefore, charging fees is not wrong and well within the law.'' ""The airport is to develop the area surrounding it and the existing Airport Authority Act allows various airports to charge the ADF,'' he added. Appearing for MIAL, senior counsel Harish Salve argued: ""When we can charge the airline companies for using landing, housing and parking facilities, then why can't we charge the passengers for using the other services at the airport?'' The public interest petition has challenged the ADF of Rs 200 cess on all outgoing domestic passengers and Rs 1,300 on international ones since March 1, 2009. Apart from alleging that the money being charged for airport development work was ""placing undue burden on travelling public'', the petition also argues that in return for the payment, the passenger is not being offered any extra facility or value by DIAL.

The gang used to make calls to people promising huge returns on life insurance policies, after stealing data from some vendors. Triveni Singh, additional SP (Noida-STF), said the arrests were linked to another fake call centre that was busted on Thursday. Some 43 people, including nine masterminds, were also arrested from its two offices in Sector 11 and Sector 62, respectively. Singh said Col Ramman Singh (retired), a resident of Fatehpur, had got an FIR registered at a local police station on March 27 this year, alleging a fraud of Rs 86.77 lakh against a promise of high returns on a life insurance policy. In his police complaint, the victim said he had received a call from some people who demanded money to initiate the process of higher returns on his policy. Over time, he realised that he had been duped of a huge sum of money. “We had busted the first call centre based on Singh’s complaint after putting the telecallers’ numbers on electronic surveillance. But money trail revealed that the amount was also transferred to the accounts of three other firms — FNF Solutions, Biolo Services and AK Services. We then identified the location of three firms in a rented office in Sector 17 and thus busted the second fake call centre on Friday,” the additional SP said. The masterminds have been identified as Prakash Kumar (25) and Yogesh Kumar (26), both residents of Nithari village, Mohit Kumar (26) of Bulandshar, and Arpit (24) of Challera village. “We have also recovered six mobile phones, fake documents of three companies and pass books of five bank accounts,” Singh said. Police said investigation has revealed that account holders, telecallers and brokers used to share dividends of 15%, 60% and 25% after duping investors. “We have also identified two data vendors and soon a raid will be conducted on them,” Singh said. The STF team has registered a case against the accused under sections 467, 468 and 420 of IPC. The accused were produced in a court and sent to judicial custody.

The worst hit were birds, with at least 50 cases of injuries reported. While the cases on record were those of birds rescued, volunteers estimate that another 200 birds might have perished or their cases not reported at all during the Sankranti period. As per the court directive, selling, storing or use of Chinese and glass coated manja is banned across the country. Forest authorities and the anti-poaching squad nabbed over 150kg of Chinese manja from several areas in the city on Sankranti. Another 350kg of were seized from other districts. Forest and wildlife officials had to take the help of police to seize the manja from 30 to 35 sellers and to prevent a backlash. “We seized manja from areas across the city, although we found more in the Old City. It is still highly in demand and remains a profitable business,” said Manoranjan Bhanja, additional principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF). At least 100kg of manja were seized from areas such as Gulzar House, Charminar, Puranapul, Dhoolpet, Ramkote, Chappal Bazaar, Hussainialam, Musheerabad and Secunderabad. While forest authorities and the anti-poaching squad conducted checks, the manja menace is supposed to be dealt with under The Environment Protection Act. “It is the pollution control board that should be implementing the act and book offenders under the Act, but we are being proactive since the manja menace is harming birds and even people. But we are not actually authorised to book cases under the Act,” said Bhanja. Rachakonda police conducted raids on kite selling shops and booked seven cases under section 5 and 15 of the Environment Protection Act.

Zara says that their relationship has had its share of upheavals and she is thrilled that they have finally made it. “I feel very blessed to be getting married to the man I love. It's definitely a very beautiful feeling. I feel ours has been a relationship that has been through its fair share of ups and downs. We passed many challenges along the way and took the time to fully know one another...And naturally, marriage would be the next step to take,” she says. The two will tie the knot on November 28. The engagement and mehendi ceremonies will take place on November 26 and 27, respectively.

Although they come from different religious backgrounds, Zara says that this has never made a difference in their relationship, and never will. “Religion, to me, comes secondary. I believe what matters more are the core values a person has been raised with. Once two people are in love...who cares about religion?” she says, adding, “Love is obviously the glue that binds us together...if we weren't in love we would not have made it this far. It's very important to show your significant other that you value them through your actions and I think Saurabh and I do that quite a bit. I see us leading a happy, blissful, and beautiful life together... working hard and traveling the world.”

As for her family, they too love Saurabh. “Saurabh is absolutely adored by entire family but I feel he is closest to my father. They share a very strong bond of love and mutual respect and it's heartwarming to see that,” she says.

Meanwhile, since both Zara and Saurabh are a part of the same industry, Zara says that this makes it easier for them to understand each other’s work. “We both understand the late nights and early mornings and everything else that comes with the job,” she says.

Ask her if she is experiencing any marriage jitters, and she says, “Oh yes! definitely but Saurabh's family has taken me in so warmly that it doesn't even feel like I'm actually taking the plunge. I'm very lucky to have such loving and understanding in-laws.”

The couple is yet to finalise its honeymoon plans. “We are so caught up with the wedding planning we haven't had time to zero in on a honeymoon destination yet!”

And, who is her ideal couple, who she looks up to for marriage advise? “I always look at my parents for inspiration. And they're definitely the ideal couple for me. They have stuck together through thick and thin. My mother has taught me that life don't always be a bed of roses but love and respect for one another will definitely make the journey more pleasurable...always respect one another...that is the key!” she says.

Addressing a rally at Ramlila Maidan, where thousands gathered to “thank Modi” for regularising unauthorised colonies and conferring property ownership rights to the people, the PM, without naming the ruling AAP, said the Centre decided to take the task in its hands when more time was sought to complete the process. “They (Delhi government) did not show the right intentions and were shamelessly demanding time till 2021 for regularisation. So, we took this job in our hands in March and, by November this year, we got a Bill on unauthorised colonies passed from both Houses of Parliament,” he said, even as pro-Modi and pro-BJP slogans hung in the air. With Delhi assembly elections due early next year, BJP has made regularisation of unauthorised colonies its main poll plank as it attempts to return to power after 21 years. Sunday’s rally was organised by Delhi BJP to express “gratitude” to the Modi-led Central government on the issue. Blaming the rival parties for delaying the regularisation process, Modi said he felt satisfied that BJP could bring a “new dawn” in the lives of over 40 lakh people. “Under PM-UDAY (Prime Minister Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana), you are getting the ownership rights of your houses and land — your biggest assets. Those who have deprived people of Delhi of their rights should come and see the faces of the people sitting here at Ramlila Maidan,” Modi said, adding that the regularisation of these colonies would give an impetus to trade and business in the city. Without naming Congress, Modi said its government was busy allotting “2,000 bungalows to industrialist friends in most posh areas (Lutyens’) when residents of unauthorised colonies were demanding removal of illegal tag”. He added: “We got the 2,000 bungalows vacated and gave ownership rights to 40 lakh people. For me, you are the VIP.” The PM blamed AAP government for delaying Delhi Metro’s expansion under Phase-IV and said the work would have been started much earlier had it not created “political hurdles”. He also blamed Congress for the “sluggish” pace of work, saying the expansion under BJP government was taking place at 25km per year compared with 14km a year under the previous regimes. He alleged that public transport had deteriorated and people were being inconvenienced during AAP’s regime. Modi claimed that by putting peripheral highways on the fast track, the Centre had stopped nearly 40,000 trucks from entering Delhi daily and, thus, curbed pollution. “In five years, several CNG stations have been opened, industries converted into PNG and stubble burning reduced,” he said. The PM urged people to carry out a cleanliness drive in their areas to usher in the new year and weed out single-use plastic. Before Modi started his address, he was given a “thank you” note signed by 11,000 people from unauthorised colonies. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari called Modi a ‘messiah’ of the poor, who never went back on his promises. Rally organiser and senior BJP leader Vijay Goel said people sat through the PM’s speech despite such the chilly weather because they believed that only BJP could deliver on the promises it made.

Her parents are now trying to piece together their broken life and move on. Shruthi’s mother Priya, who had surgical sterilization after the birth of Shruthi, recently had a reversal surgery in the hope of getting another child. Priya, who underwent the surgery in Kerala, said nobody could replace Shruthi, but they want to have a child to comfort her elder son Pranav. “He misses the closeness he had with his sister, the fun and the fights they had. We are hopeful that God would bless us with another child,” Priya said, fighting back tears.  Priya has been treasuring Shruthi’s dresses and the little items of makeup that the child liked to use when she had to go to a function. Priya was expecting Shruthi to return home when she was informed that the Class 2 student of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Indira Nagar was crushed under the wheels of the bus, less than 100 feet from the spot where she was waiting for the child.  On Thursday, Shruthi’s first death anniversary, her parents R Sethumadhavan and Priya cooked sweet pongal and vegetable rice. “She was fond of that,” said Priya. “She insisted I cook vegetable rice and Pongal for her lunch to school most of the time. We are heartbroken that our time with her was so brief.”  A couple of weeks ago, the couple visited their native place, Ottapalam in Kerala, and offered prayers for Shruthi. “The loss of a child is the most painful loss for a human being,” said Sethumadhavan. “Shruthi was always an active child, good at dancing and drawing,” her mother said. “Teachers told us that she was the most spirited child in her class and would readily agree to participate in any competition.”  Priya spoke carefully, because she did not want Pranav to hear her talk about Shruthi’s accident. “He becomes very emotional when someone talks about his sister,” she said.  When officials of Shruthi’s school offered her parents compensation, they turned it down. “Loss of a life cannot be compensated with money,” Priya said.

With India beset by pre-monsoon and monsoon showers, many aviators are nervous about the tumult unleashed by the heavens. But what’s worrying them more is the curb by management's on the amount of fuel they carry, leading to concerns about flight safety.  “Pilots who took more fuel are being constantly asked for an explanation by the management and emails are being sent to them with details of the extra fuel they used and the number of such flights undertaken. They are then called for counseling,” says an upset commander of a leading private airline. “Even if we take 150 kg more than the advisory given by the airline, we’re pulled up. How can we fly like this?”  So stressed are some of the pilots over this that they are now taking whatever fuel is being offered without questioning. But that could lead to situations where safety is compromised. Incidentally, 1,100 kg (approx) of fuel lasts just 30 minutes in a mid-sized A320 or B737.  Mandatory airline norms allow for enough fuel to be carried from point A to B, B to an alternate destination, plus 30 minutes holding time. There are variations from airline to airline, but requirements stay the same.  Under normal conditions, this makes sense. But often, some private airlines give just enough fuel without factoring in unforeseen circumstances that can crop up during monsoons when the sub-continent is buffeted by strong, violent winds and rain, especially in the east, north-east and south. Depleted fuel resources then can make all the difference between life and death.  One pilot remembers with a shudder how he had once landed at an airport with just enough fuel to divert, but not enough to negotiate treacherous weather. Another says that even diversion points are often cities which are just a stone’s throw away from the original destination and have the same inclement weather. “Why can’t we be given enough fuel to fly to a place further away with better weather?” he asks. The ideal amount of fuel that should be given over and above the stipulated amount, says a senior pilot, is 500-750 kg.  While airlines in India have to, no doubt, keep a watch over fuel, considering it’s 40% of operating costs, doing so at the risk of lives is another matter. Kanu Gohain, ex-director general of civil aviation, asks, “Are airline stipulations done taking into consideration the worst weather? Computer-generated flight plans often don’t factor in uncalled-for delays and weather deviations.” Singapore Airlines, for instance, has no curbs on fuel uptake. “Anticipated delays at airports such as Mumbai, Delhi and NY can see extra fuel being uplifted without the pilot even asking for it,” says a commander with the company. “Pilots are almost never questioned as long as the extra fuel is reasonably extra (15-30 minutes of extra flying time in addition to what’s operationally required).”  Airline managements in India were reluctant to go on record but said they left fuel uptake to the pilot’s discretion and that it should be “justified”. A SpiceJet source said habitual offenders are ‘counselled’. “More fuel is generally taken by older pilots who have flown in times when the absence of accurate computer-generated flight plans made them err too much on the side of caution,” said one commander.

For starters, Congress may be forced to postpone the transition of power that was on the cards since Rahul’s appointment as party No.2 last January. In fact, Sonia Gandhi may have to continue in leadership for longer than she had planned.  Given that the slide has coincided with Rahul’s entry to the centrestage, the obvious target of partymen’s anger would his advisors and his policies. The big worry is that murmurs may be followed by loud talk and even desertion from the party by state leaders expressing low confidence in the Congress scion. Party leaders say it could be a trying time for Congress.  Experience suggests that there may not be direct attacks on the scion, at least not at the outset. Congressmen have traditionally used euphemisms like “style of functioning” and preferred to target advisers instead of the leader. Slogans demanding that Priyanka join politics — heard during the campaign — will now be treated as a vote of no-confidence in Rahul.  The attack would be on the issues the party chose to run on. In contrast to Rahul’s pitch for inclusive politics but without convincing proposals to spur growth, Modi came in headlong with his promise of growth and job generation, exposing how ruling party strategists had failed to read the mood.  Rahul’s bid to play the “outsider” also failed, with Modi successfully yoking the “shehzada” to UPA’s tattered legacy from which he was trying to distance. BJP’s relentless focus on the land deals of Robert Vadra hurt too, making the family’s claim of having kept away from dodgy dealings of the government look suspect. By the time the campaign ended, ‘Ma bete ki sarkar’ had acquired a lethal edge.  The setback may dampen the enthusiasm for radical restructuring of the organization and can be a hurdle in Rahul’s attempts to rebuild the party in areas where it has got weakened. The 16th Lok Sabha may see Congress revert to “secular” camaraderie with regional parties with whom it broke ranks after the 2009 sweep.  The defeat will severely test Rahul’s ability to push ideas like “primaries” to select election candidates through internal voting. While the initiative has its critics, a weakened leadership may bring out the opposition in the open.  Team Rahul may also have to tread carefully on the much-touted “democratization” of frontal outfits NSUI and Youth Congress. There is pent up resentment that internal elections to choose youth leaders has institutionalized corruption with the kin of powerful partymen using money power to secure control of the outfits.  Far from re-energizing the youth outfits, which are seen as the party’s “sword arms”, the experiment seems to have dimmed their agitational spirit.

Their aim, as part of a coordination committee in Defence of Animals, was to prevent cruelty to animals. The rally coincided with the one being organised in London to mark World Day for Animals in Laboratories which wants to bring to an experimentation on animals. Hiranmay Karlekar, one of the co-convenors of CCDA, said: ""A number of municipal bodies capture stray dogs in the most cruel manner causing serious injuries to them in the process and either kill them or release them on the outskirts in the city. These dogs eventually die horrible deaths as they do not know how to fend for themselves in unfamiliar surroundings. This action is in gross violation of the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules which only allows stray dogs to be removed for sterilisation, vaccination. Under ABC rules, the dogs should be returned where they were picked up from."" The participants demanded effective action against illegal slaughtering houses where animals are killed cruelly, strict implementation of livestock transport rules and prevention of atrocities on street animals. They said the trend of people feeding or taking care of strays should be encouraged. Many animal lovers voiced concern overt “stray dogs being rounded-up across the city before Commonwealth Games and being taken elsewhere"". Jaya Jaitely, former president of the Samata Party of India, said: ""There is talks of removing stray dogs from their natural surroundings before the Games. This is like taking someone out of their homes. We should take into account the rights of animals. We should not try to change the face of the city for an event that is taking place for only two weeks. Moreover, why have the authorities woken up to the stray animal problems now, it has been there for years now and we should be proud of the way Delhi is."" Bands like Them Clones, Indian Ocean, Bandish, etc showed their support to the cause by performing outside Jantar Mantar. Kala Gujarati, who looks after eight to 10 dogs in CP and earns her living by selling cushion covers stressed on the need for compassion to animals. Though she struggles to make ends meet, for Kala and her children the dogs are like extended family. Classical dancer Sonal Mansingh said: ""The arrogance of humans has crossed all limits. Why are we trying to prove to the world that Delhi is better than world-class cities by dislocating animals from their surroundings?""

The 17-year-old, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma a few years ago, got to meet his idol, A R Rahman. All thanks to Make-A-Wish, the children’s charity that aims to bring a smile to the faces of ailing children. On Saturday, the Chennai division of the organisation will conduct their first anniversary celebrations.  “Before I got my wish, I was depressed. I had to often bunk school because of my illness and used to miss my friends a lot,” says Kankaria, who plays the keyboard. “I love Rahman’s music. So my biggest desire was to meet him. I met him on his birthday, January 16, and played the keyboard for him. He said I play very well and presented me with a S3 mobile,” says Kankaria, who wants to join Rahman’s music school.  Make-A-Wish India was established in 1996 in Mumbai, by Uday and Geetha Joshi, whose son Gandhar had leukemia. “While undergoing treatment in the US, his wish to visit Disney Land was fulfilled and, though they later lost him, they saw how the experience had changed him. He accepted treatment more willingly and looked at life with hope and joy,” says Dr Bakhtawar.  Today, Make-A-Wish India has 11 divisions across the country and fulfills 3,500 wishes a year.  Make-A-Wish, Chennai division, turned one on February 15 but is conducting their first anniversary celebrations with a fundraiser event on Saturday at the Ambassador Pallava hotel, from 7pm. The evening will see some performances by some of the children, wish granting to a few children, a performance by Evam theatre group and dinner. Some of the doctors, volunteers, and sponsors will also be honoured on the occasion.  Wishes, granted to children between three and 18 years of age, can be of four types -- it can be a wish to have something (a Barbie doll, cycle, or laptop), to be someone (for instance, an army officer or doctor for a day), a wish to see something (popular destinations in India include the Taj Mahal) or a wish to meet someone (children have met celebrities like Suriya, Rajinikanth and Vijay).  “Doctors treating the children suggest their names and our volunteers will visit the child in the hospital, and figure out their most cherished wish,” says Dr Bakhtawar. “People can come forward and adopt a wish of a child.” ","['medical', 'doctor', 'college', 'seat', 'admission', 'student', 'mbbs', 'mci', 'hospital', 'government']",Education,state government plan affiliate government private medical college king medical university comfortably forgotten another medical dhanvantri ayurvigyan sansthan created similar line already dmu working two room rehabilitation artificial limb centre last four government seems decided dump say principal medical jagjit one medical university kgmu already authorised grant affiliation medical college decision hope employee working without salary last four uplift homeopathy unani medical college appears bleak kgmu give affiliation government private allopathy sharp contrast objective created raise education standard ayurvedic unani barring kgmc six medical ayurvedic two unani college homeopathic college college private sector state affiliated dmu reason given college affiliated various university able maintain desired quality proposal develop kgmu centre excellence government medical college kgmu supposed academic control private medical unani homeopathy college proposed plan dmu created government order january recommendation headed chief member panel principal secretary finance medical education committee visited south indian state study model medical osd appointed july november lakh sanctioned state contingency fund creating purchase maintenance office common syllabus examination system special provision research medical stream proposed general medical said act approved law awas vikas parishad agreed give acre later due delay project withdrew several reminder fund sent government money,Healthcare,No,,

Sridevi’s death has shocked the entire country, for a 54 year-old city schoolteacher it hit home hard. Sai Mudliar was a Bollywood junior artiste in the mid-80s and he recalled his association with Sridevi on the sets of ‘Mr India’. 

“The most vivid memories I have is from when we were filming the song ‘Hawaa Hawaai’ at Natraj Studios. It took 10 days for the song to be complete and we would shoot for minimum nine hours daily,” said Mudliar. He also played a cameo in another Sridevi starrer ‘Roop ki Rani Choron ka Raja’.

In the ‘Hawaa Hawaai’ song, Mudliar plays the role of one of villain’s men. He can be seen standing near Ajit Vachani (Teja seth), Sharat Saxena (Daga seth) and Bob Christo (Mr Wolcott) as Sridevi effortlessly glides by in the dance sequence right in front him. 

“Though I was a junior artiste I managed to strike a rapport with Sridevi because of our Tamil connect and I was very close to her two male cousins who accompanied her to the sets,” said Mudliar. He would run small errands for her directly, or sometimes at the behest of the producer Boney Kapoor (whom she married in the 90s). 

“I was pretty thick with Boney and you can call me his chamcha,” laughed Mudliar, speaking straight from the heart. “Sridevi was staying at Hotel Sea Rock at that time but did not like it too much. Boney would ask me to run over there and inquire from the cousins what issues they were facing. Soon she was shifted to Hotel Centaur and ultimately to a private bungalow, all courtesy Boney who cared for Sridevi a lot,” said Mudliar. 

Though she was a superstar at that time, there were no tantrums. “She ate the same food as other artistes but was conscious about eating healthy. I remember clearly that she avoided samosa and tea. Later when she shifted to a bungalow, she started getting home-cooked food,” said Mudliar. Her professionalism stood out despite her star status. “At sharp 9am, Sridevi would be at the sets ready for the shoot. She neither gossiped on the sets nor threw tantrums, setting a great example for all junior artistes,” said Mudliar.

The floods have claimed 47 lives so far. (Watch)Floodwaters entered new areas on Tuesday and have affected two million people so far in Supaul, Araria and Madhepura districts. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that a breach in the Kosi embankment near Kusaha in Nepal had forced the river to change its course, for the first time since the 1950s.The Chief Minister said it was not a normal annual flooding, but a catastrophe.Most of the marooned people have been without food and water for five days. Despite the government maintaining that it has air dropped relief material and set up relief camps, crowds of displaced people perched on embankments were seen protesting against inadequate government help.""This time, the flood has been caused by a two km breach in the embankment of river Kosi.

When PWD initiated works by demolishing walls near Pirappancode, a group of local residents protested. They alleged that they were kept in the dark over land acquisition and offered no money as compensation for demolition of the walls. The PWD is planning a ring road to solve the issue of traffic congestion in the Venjaramoodu Junction. The Rs 32 crore ring road will include the stretch from Pirappancode that joins MC Road at Ambalamukku and Attingal-Venjaramoodu stretch which will join MC Road near Venjaramoodu police station. On Wednesday when contractor of the project began to demolish walls on the road side, people disrupted the work. Sudhakaran Nair, a local resident at Puthalam near Pirappancode, said that he was no informed about demolition of his wall. “We are not against giving our land for development. But we should be informed. Also we must be given money for construction of a new wall,” he said. The local people approached Venjaramoodu police with a complaint. The police, however, said that they have not registered the complaint. Sources in PWD said that they began work after majority of people agreed to hand over land free of cost. “People are fed with up the congestion in Venjaramoodu Junction. With the development of ring road, these areas will develop and land value will increase. So, most people agreed to surrender their land free of cost. However, like any other development project, there are some people who oppose it,” said an official of PWD, adding that they have not earmarked money as compensation for walls. Sudhakaran Nair said they had filed a complaint with judicial first class magistrate court, Nedumangad against acquisition. D K Murali MLA said that the project was started after forming a people’s committee to discuss the land acquisition work. “Almost 90% of people agreed to co-operate,” he said.

The court had asked the government to explain why it took the PMO more than a year to tell Swamy that Raja’s prosecution would be premature at that stage. Then PMO official V Vidyavati had found that the paper trail on Swamy’s petition to the then PM Manmohan Singh went back to November 29, 2008. The SC was told a response was sent to Swamy on March 19, 2010. Within days of receiving the petition on November 29, 2008, Singh had noted on December 1, 2008, “Please examine and let me know the facts of this case.” And then it went round and round from one department to another. Meanwhile, two more letters were received by the PMO from Gurudas Dasgupta and Survaran Sudhakar. The PMO decided to bunch them with Swamy’s petition and requested the department of telecom to send a “suitable reply to both MPs and Swamy”. The bench had asked, “The department of personnel and training letter terms the petition premature. Does this mean his (Swamy’s) right to seek sanction has not ripened yet? And did the sanctioning authority know at the time of filing the petition that there will be a CBI probe? We are on alleged inaction and silence. The outcome of CBI inquiry is totally outside his control. That is what is worrying us. Can someone’s legal right be asked to wait?” However, after elaborate explanations by the then attorney general G E Vahanvati and the then solicitor general Gopal Subramanium, the SC had closed the issue saying, “We have no doubt that if the Prime Minister had been apprised of the factual and legal position regarding the representation made by Swamy, he would have surely taken an appropriate decision and would not have allowed the matter to linger for a period of more than one year. By the very nature of the office held by the Prime Minister, he was not expected to personally look into the minute details of each case placed before him and has to depend on his advisers and other officers. Unfortunately, those who were expected to give proper advice to him and place full facts and legal position before him failed to do so.” ","['drug', 'heroin', 'arrested', 'seized', 'narcotic', 'police', 'substance', 'cocaine', 'ganja', 'addict']",Crime,cell goa police conducted raid kiosk anjuna saturday arrested local alleged illegal possession narcotic substance worth based information reliable anc obtained search warrant conducting search anc sleuth saturday night conducted search found lsd paper weighing gram worth police arrested accused rocky manuel resident illegally storing alleged narcotic substance run general produced local court remanded nine day judicial police said accused earlier arrested crime branch ndps act later released anc registered case various section ndps act psi dinesh gadekar investigating,Corruption,No,,

Authorities from north western railway (NWR) had already asked the railway board to give a green signal for operation of the trains. However, the board has yet not given the clearance. As the gauge conversion work on this route from Jaipur to Delhi via Ringas has already completed, NWR is planning to operate some of the popular trains which were operated during meter gauge time. However, it will take more time for these trains to get started. ""We have already written to the railway board to get the sanction of a few trains which are proposed to be operated between Jaipur and Delhi connecting Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu districts.

NWR had written to the railway board on September 10 and they are yet to get any clearance to operate the trains. ""In Haryana, the vote counting is on October 21 while for Mandawa and Khinvsar, voting is on October 21 and counting on October 24. Thus, it is most unlikely to get our trains prior to October 24.
