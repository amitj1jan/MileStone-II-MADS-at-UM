Primary and secondary education minister Visveshwara Hegde Kageri on Wednesday said all students in state syllabus schools should be 16 years before they can appear for the SSLC examination. ""Around 17,000 students in the state did not meet this norm this academic year. There’s no point trying to enforce this during the current academic year,"" he said, adding the government would curtail this by strictly adhering to the age of admission to Class 1 from academic year 2010-11. Kageri admitted this problem would persist for another nine years as admissions have already been done. To avoid confusion in future, the government will ensure that only students aged at least five years as on May 31 of that academic year will be admitted to Class 1. There will be an allowance of 10 additional months i.e. a student aged up to 5 years 10 months can be admitted to Class 1. Kageri, who interacted with presspersons on the sidelines of his visit to Mangalore, was reacting to media reports which raised a question mark on the fate of 17,000-odd such underage students. Stating that he wished to clarify on this issue alone, Kageri said the age limit of 16 years for students taking the SSLC examination can be adhered to only when the age rule is enforced strictly during admission to Class 1. IS HE IGNORANT? Section 11 of the Karnataka Education Act on the enforcement of compulsory primary education states: ""The state government by order or directive with effect from the commencement of academic year must admit children with such age group as may be specified in the order provided that a child who has completed the age of five years shall not be denied admission into the school..."" And Section 20 says: ""The age of a child for the purpose of this act shall be computed in terms of years completed by the child or on before the first day of the academic year.’’ ","['student', 'school', 'education', 'teacher', 'class', 'college', 'university', 'admission', 'exam', 'course']",Education,candidate thronged government school city apply teaching post might fall temporarily vacant monday due ongoing strike government state school education department earlier announced government teacher drop protest lose posting replaced temporary retired staff consolidated pay state protesting teacher return work monday face disciplinary proceeding might work different school depending vacancy bear pay cut absence till sunday teacher suspended participating protest case registered unlawful public wrongful restraint deterring public servant discharge boycotted work application invited temporarily fill vacancy applied till sunday according official joint action committee tamil nadu teacher employee organization reiterated continue protest till demand indefinite strike since pressing charter including revival old pension pay par central government teacher payment month rejected claim state fishery minister jayakumar increasing pay scale toll amount spent towards welfare state school education expressed willingness hold talk resolve issue functioning school since school fully functional due high rate absenteeism among besides primary higher secondary student left though practical exam board begin next preparatory work standstill,Education,Yes,Correct,15

Not chief minister Mayawati. On Thursday, Behenji made her second foray to the ""jinxed'' township where her macho counterparts simply dread to tread. With its malls, multiplexes and now a brand new Metro Noida, more like a Delhi twin and unlike its impoverished cousins back home has been untouchable here for well over two decades. A trip to Noida is considered to be the surest and fastest way of getting out of the CM's office. What may have begun as a joke in late eighties (1988, 1989) after Veer Bahadur Singh and N D Tiwari were ousted within a month of crossing the dreaded line, has lost its humour along the way. A coincidence or curse similar incidents later only landed credence to it. Subsequent occupants to the CM's chair, including Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rajnath Singh and Ram Prakash Gupta, have, therefore, taken great pains to avoid Noida even at the cost of public ridicule.His detractors recount with glee how Ranjath had gone out of the way, quite literally, to skirt Noida during his chief ministership in 2002. Singh, called upon to inaugurate the Noida-Delhi flyover, chose to do the hours sticking along the safe Delhi borders than taking the risk of going the other way round. He had learnt from Kalyan Singh's goof-up. In 1999, Kalyan had to quit within three months of attending a public function in Noida. His successor Ram Prakash Gupta proved wiser and never headed that way during his entire tenure. It was a typical case of ""once bitten twice shy'' for Mulayam Singh Yadav. The SP supremo had visited Noida in 1995 to inaugurate a school. Flushed with the adventure, he even boldly declared from the podium that he had taken the step deliberately to break the Noida myth. The words must have hounded the Yadav chieftains for long after Mayawati pulled the rugs from under his feet within weeks of the trip by walking out of the alliance.So, he can hardly be blamed for being extra cautious during the next tenure. When the brutal rape and murder of over 20 kids in Nithari hit the headlines (2006-07), the chief minister of UP kept a safe distance from the scene. Though Yadav did surface in Delhi to participate in a demonstration against the hanging of Saddam Hussain at the peak of the controversy, brother Shivpal Singh Yadav represented him in Nithari for condolence. In fact, a tickled Rajnath even advised Mulayam to go to Nithari as he was most likely to become the CM once again and had therefore nothing to fear.Mayawati, it seems, would not be easily intimidated. While some see a clear link between her Noida visit and exit in 1997, Behenji couldn't care less. Incidentally, she is the last CM to have set foot in Noida. In November last, she gave enough reasons to the doomsayer by attending a wedding of close comrade Satish Mishra's niece in Noida. Almost a year has passed and very much in the saddle, Mayawati is back once again to prove that a clear mandate is the best myth-buster.","['polling', 'voter', 'election', 'booth', 'electoral', 'poll', 'vote', 'voting', 'constituency', 'commission']",Election,continuous process correction made till day last day filing nomination assembly fill form correct wrong detail epic special drive last corrected voter said joint chief electoral officer joint secretary government dpar said error creep card data entry manually special lakh application correction inclusion one data entry operator enter voter per day work huge mother roll reviewed survey time permit electoral roll error told anil kumar chief electoral surprising error still crept used software detect age photo mismatch detail entered wrongly epic deletion inclusion continuous time till electoral roll published january window said error creep data regarding detail lakh people entered short duration inclusion deletion lakh apply inclusion name november january deleted name restored list lakh people name removed electoral roll found ineligible voter,Election,Yes,Incorrect,5

That probably is an apt indication of how much the play Bhakta Prahlada enacted at Public Gardens on Monday as part of the Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Festival, endeared itself to the gathering. Performed by Surabhi Theatre, one of India’s oldest mobile theatre repertory groups, the 110-minute play starts off with the two gatekeepers of Vaikunta (Lord Vishnu’s abode), Jaya and Vijaya being cursed by rishis to be born as demons on earth for their irreverent behaviour. They are subsequently born as the asuras, Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu. While Hiranyaksha is killed by Lord Vishnu, the latter, thanks to a boon from Lord Brahma becomes the ‘Lord of the Three Worlds’. Ironically, though, his son Prahlada grows up as an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu. An infuriated Hiranyakashipu tries in vain to change his son’s devotion and ultimately decides to have him killed, only to meet his own end at the hands of Lord Vishnu. Apart from the performances, the highlights of the play were the special effects coupled with the seamless and instantaneous transition of the setting from one episode to the other. For instance, pleased with the penance of Hiranyakashipu, Lord Brahma decides to grant him darshan and emerges from the earth. This was depicted realistically. The scenes where Prahlada is shown as an infant in the arms of his mother, and the very next minute as a toddler and then a young boy, is depicted in a seamless fashion. the timing was so quick and instantaneous that the viewer does not experience any discontinuity. The lighting was also apt and perfectly described the moods of the characters on stage. For example, the face of Hiranyakashipu turns a dark red when he is angry. Hiranyaksha’s journey to the nether world and his encounter with the Varaha avatar of Lord Vishnu, makes use of various hues of blue, red and green to depict the moods. On the whole, it was quite a delightful evening for the patrons and what was especially heartening to see was families turning up in large numbers with their kids in tow. The funny antics of the asuras when trying to kill young Prahlada, had the youngsters in peals of laughter. At the end of it all, there was a satisfied smile on the face of Nageswara Rao aka Surabhi Babji, the head of the troupe. A fifth-generation practitioner of this art form, Rao says, “Our family has been running Surabhi for eight generations now. As long as I’m heading the group, we’ll do everything possible to keep our art form alive and protect this tradition. We are a joint-family of 55, all devoted to our art.’ He further adds, “The government is quite supportive but we hope they give us some permanent land in the city that would help us set up a facility with a seating capacity of around 500. They are offering us land on the outskirts of the city but the problem is that patrons will not travel that far to watch a play.” ","['wedding', 'marriage', 'couple', 'groom', 'guest', 'bride', 'ceremony', 'married', 'family', 'friend']",LIfeStyle,wedding reception son medico guruva bride harsha one cool sunday afternoon quite impressive guestlist city turning film biggies like balakrishna krishna walked looking casual politico like lagadapati rajagopal badminton guru pullela gopichand turned bless looked picture,Entertainment,No,,

4,729455,9/6/2011,40,0.851096,2011,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tells-china-to-stop-infrastructure-work-in-pok/articleshow/9877687.cms," NEW DELHI: India has asked China to stop its infrastructure development activities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, even as it keeps a close watch on Beijing's ""rapid"" development of strategic roads, railway lines and airfields in Tibet as well as along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Defence minister A K Antony, in a written reply to Lok Sabha on Monday to a question posed by 18 MPs, said, ""Government is aware that China is undertaking infrastructure projects in PoK. We have conveyed our concerns to China about its activities in PoK and asked them to cease such activities."" This comes after senior Indian Army commanders recently warned that India not only faced the threat from Chinese troops along the LAC with China but it could well extend to the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan due to the expansive Beijing-Islamabad military nexus. Apart from the massive build-up of Chinese military infrastructure all along the 4,057-km LAC, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), there is growing concern about the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops actually being stationed along the volatile 778-km-long LoC between India and Pakistan. Antony, on his part, said, ""China has also been carrying out rapid infrastructure development in TAR and in areas along the India-China border. It's carrying out construction of strategic roads, railway lines and airfields close to the LAC, which has improved its military capability."" As earlier reported by TOI, this includes five fully-operational airbases, an extensive rail network and over 58,000-km of roads in TAR. India is now belatedly taking steps to strategically counter China's build-up, which ranges from deploying Sukhoi-30MKI fighters in the North-East to plans to raise a new mountain strike corps after raising two new mountain infantry divisions, with 1,260 officers and 35,011 soldiers. While the 56 Division has its HQ in Zakama (Nagaland) under the Dimapur-based 3 Corps, the 71 Division at Missamari (Assam) falls in the operational command of the Tezpur-based 4 Corps.

In the fourth phase, 47% crorepatis will test the poll waters. That's not all. The state may not have progressed, but the assets of several candidates have registered a fourfold increase over the past five years.  The highest percentage growth in assets – a whopping 4750% -- is that of Samajwadi Party candidate Sudhir Kumar, who is contesting from Safipur (SC) seat. Kumar’s assets rose from Rs 1.29 lakh in 2007 to Rs 62.90 lakh in 2012. Kumar is followed by Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Rajeshwari who is contesting from Sandi (SC) seat. Her assets have increased by 1631% -- from Rs 4.40 lakh in 2007 to Rs 76.17 lakh in 2012. Another BSP candidate, Sanjay, in fray from Pratapgarh, has registered the third highest percentage increase in assets.  His assets rose by 918% from Rs 33.74 lakh in 2007 to Rs 3.43 crore in 2012. If overall assets have shot up, so has the number of candidates with criminal background. A total of 966 candidates are trying their luck in the fourth phase covering 11 districts. An analysis of affidavits of 297 candidates done by civil society organisation Uttar Pradesh Election Watch has revealed that 103 candidates have criminal antecedents; a whopping 35% criminal elements vying for political power.  In comparison, only 27% candidates had declared criminal cases against themselves during the 2007 assembly election. Among major political parties, the Samajwadi Party, despite claims of fielding candidates with a clean image, has given ticket to maximum persons (29 out of 54) with a criminal record. In comparison, Congress has fielded 25, BSP 18, BJP 11 and Peace Party 7 candidates in the fourth phase who have pending criminal cases against them. The candidate in this phase with maximum criminal cases in his name is Ravidas Mehrotra of SP, contesting from Lucknow Central.  Mehrotra has 17 criminal cases, including 7 serious IPC cases against him. Pushpendra Singh of BSP, contesting from Rae Bareli, has nine criminal cases, including those of attempt to murder. Other candidates with a criminal record are Congress’s Ramesh Srivastava contesting from Lucknow East and Dherendra Bahadur Singh of BJP, contesting from Sareni.

Appearing for Kunjwal, counsel Kapil Sibal said the question to be put to the nine dissident MLAs is ""how they went to BJP"" and whether ""they have violated the 10th schedule of the Constitution (provisions as to disqualification on ground of defection)"".""If they have violated the 10th schedule, how can they seek stay of disqualification,"" Sibal asked. ""How can they seek stay of disqualification when according to the division bench (of Uttarakhand high court) they have committed the Constitutional sin of defection?"" he said ""When they joined BJP and signed the memorandum (for division of votes), they knew it was unethical and unconstitutional,"" Sibal argued.  Requesting immediate dismissal of the petition by the rebels Sibal also accused the nine rebels of suppression of facts and also not showing due diligence as petitioners. ""This petition should be dismissed at the threshold without going into its merits,"" asserted Sibal in the HC.  Sibal remarked to the court that that BJP, who is accusing Congress of horse trading had already done it as ""nine horses already bolted"" referring to the nine Congress rebels. The court will hear the arguments of the rebels on April 25. Requesting immediate dismissal of the petition by the rebels, Sibal also accused the nine of suppressing facts and also not showing due diligence as petitioners. Accusing the rebels of jumping the hierarchy of the courts, Sibal argued that if they wanted the matter to be heard in the apex court they should have filed an affidavit citing a valid reason for this.  The counsel for the speaker also mentioned the division bench's order which said that the nine rebels have committed a 'sin' of defection. Further talking about the joint memorandum submitted to the governor which was signed by the 26 BJP and nine rebel Congress MLAs, Sibal added, ""When they joined the BJP and signed the memorandum (for division of votes) it was unethical and unconstitutional."" The single bench of justice UC Dhyani after hearing the arguments of Sibal said that if any order has to be passed, time will be required to think about the case as floor test was to be held on April 29.Earlier, as the argument started at around 12.01pm, the rebels' counsel sought adjournment and informed the court that they have filed a transfer application in the apex court for this case. Reacting to this the court said that the matter will not be adjourned and they can get it transferred to the Supreme Court.

Five Lok Sabha seats -- Bengaluru Central, Bengaluru South, Bengaluru North, Bengaluru Rural and Chikkaballapura -- fall in the purview of the state capital, and four of them will see parties competing for Vokkaliga votes by fielding candidates most likely to win from the region’s dominant community. “The voting pattern in the just-concluded assembly polls is a pointer for political parties formulating their strategy for the Lok Sabha polls. The clear indicator of the outcome of the state elections is that Vokkaliga votes are decisive in Bengaluru region, and parties will try to consolidate them, apart from reaching out to other communities, including backward classes and Dalits,” said N K Mohanram, a political analyst. Among the 28 assembly seats in the city, 12 constituencies elected candidates from the peasant community, including Reddys and Vokkaligas, while Vokkaliga votes played a key role in shaping results in other seats. BJP ON THE BACKFOOTThe biggest challenge in the region is before the BJP, which despite having three of five seats in its kitty in the current Lok Sabha, is beginning on the backfoot: party stalwart Union minister H N Ananth Kumar is unlikely to contest from Bengaluru South, which he has held for more than two decades, due to health reasons. Already lagging behind the Congress-JD(S) combine in terms of not getting its plot right, the BJP has a serious problem on its hands: lack of a credible Vokkaliga face in Bengaluru region. The party’s problems have been compounded by its Vokkaliga leaders, D V Sadananda Gowda, Union minister and Bengaluru North MP, and R Ashoka squabbling over the recent BBMP mayoral elections. While the party is learnt to be mulling swapping Gowda’s seat with that of Chikkamagaluru-Udupi MP Shobha Karandlaje, Chikkamagaluru MLA C T Ravi emerged a strong contender for the Vokkaliga leadership within the BJP. His recent nomination to party president Amit Shah’s feedback group is being seen as a significant development in the BJP. “The feedback group has a big role ahead of the elections. As far as other responsibilities are concerned, the party will take a call,” said Ravi. CONG-JD(S) AHEAD IN GAMEThe Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress, which are most likely to join hands, seem to be ahead of the BJP in charting out a clear roadmap to lure Vokkaliga votes in the national polls. Sources said that while the JD(S) is bargaining for 10 seats in the state, it is planning to field its candidates in three constituencies -- Bengaluru North, Central and Chikkaballapura -- in the city region. The party might field Vokkaliga candidates from two of these seats. Party supremo HD Deve Gowda’s grandsons, Prajwal Revanna and Nikhil Kumaraswamy, are being tipped for Bengaluru North and Chikkaballapura, which is now held by Congress. The JD(S) is likely to field a Muslim candidate from Bengaluru Central, if the Congress spares this seat. “The party leadership is exploring various permutations and combinations and the candidates will soon be finalised. The party prefers doing it early so that candidates get enough time for electioneering,” said R Prakash, JD(S) president of the Bengaluru unit. The Congress, at the outset, is accommodative of the JD(S) and looking at a strategy to maximise the winning prospects of the Congress-JD(S) combine. It will be making a determined bid to wrest Bengaluru South from the BJP. As the seat has been represented by either a Brahmin or Vokkaliga for decades now, the party is learnt to be considering fielding candidates from any of the two communities. If it is Brahmin, then KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao, whose father had once won the seat, may be the candidate. But party insiders said the preference would be for a Vokkaliga and the names of Priya Krishna and Krishna Byre Gowda, who gave BJP’s H N Ananth Kumar a tough fight in 2009, are doing the rounds. “It is up to the party high command to decide on the candidature and we are ready to take up any responsibility the party leadership deems fit,” said former minister M Krishnappa, Priya Krishna’s father, a contender for a ministerial berth ahead of the cabinet expansion expected this month.

At some places, they run precariously across residential areas, even just an arm���s length away from the window or the balcony. Transformers are as close to the house as the neighbour���s compound wall.Death seems to be lurking all over. One typical locality is Rustumbagh Layout off HAL Airport Road. The area is crowded with residential apartments and office complexes, and one can imagine the danger these power lines pose. Rustumbagh Layout is not the only area in Bangalore where death is looming overahead as it were. Electrocution is a common occurrence across the city. Every year, Bangalore witnesses at least five such deaths which clearly shows the negligence of the authorities. Corrective actions are merely promised, and are forgotten till the next tragedy.In one such incident on Saturday, 14-year-old Arjun, who was trying to catch pigeons on his house terrace at Shivanagar, suffered electric shock. The high tension wires that hung low took his life as 11,000 volts power passed through his body and even gutted the house wirings. Arjun, who received 90% burns, succumbed to injuries on Sunday around 1.15 am at the Victoria Hospital burns ward.Climb up any of the high-rise buildings or apartments, power lines are dangerously close. Ironically, the city that was the first to have an electric bulb lit in India way back in 1905, has to go a long way on the modernization track. Work is still on to relocate the high tension lines by taking them underground. According to Bescom officials, almost 60% of the high power lines have been taken underground connecting the newer compact sub-stations. Now, even low-tension lines with about 220 or 440 volts of power are going underground. The central areas of the city like M G Road, Commercial Street, Raj Bhavan Road and Vidhana Soudha have underground power lines. Still, several peripheral parts of the city have overhead high tension lines hanging precariously near residential and office buildings. Underground cable works are yet to be completed in many areas across the city like Peenya, Whitefield, Hosur Road and on HAL Airport Road, besides the new residential areas that have come up in the outer parts of the city.According to Bescom managing director Tushar Girinath, underground cables are laid when road widening works are taken up and in almost all the central parts of the city, underground power lines are in place. Girinath has sought an inquiry into Saturday���s tragic incident of electrocution and the report will be submitted by his officials in the next three days.","['police', 'suicide', 'body', 'murder', 'found', 'family', 'arrested', 'two', 'said', 'near']",Crime,four policeman beaten sector police post resident sector tuesday police managed arrest five incident took place asi azad posted sector police post rounded person fighting creating nuisance said one sunil called brother resident ram arrived odd person including group forced entry police post started misbehaving azad police manhandled uniform constable duty tried intervene received police force called managed free azad singh constable unruly azad suffered minor person booked charge assaulting public servant causing parmod udayvir munni,Civic,No,,

Contrary to the state government’s tomtomming its “achievements” in rural health, the central audit revealed financial irregularities and misappropriation of central funds for the project. The Centre gave Rs 5,269.70 crore to the state in the last fiscal to revamp rural healthcare but the state failed on a host of key parameters. Goals for infant and maternal mortality rates not achieved: Infant mortality rate (IMR) in the state was 51 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rate (MMR) stood at a shocking 221 per 1,00,000, way higher than the national average (40 and 167). The report said shortfall in providing maternal, child and reproductive healthcare services resulted in the failure in achieving targets. Maternal Healthcare: Out of the 93.72 lakh pregnant women registered for ante-natal care during 2011-16, only 52.51 lakh (56%) were registered within first trimester of pregnancies and 19.44 lakh (21%) pregnant women did not undergo three check-ups. As a result, well-being and the progress of foetal growth could not be ascertained in such cases. HIV &amp; VDRL tests not conducted: HIV testing of 47.27 lakh and VDRL testing of 60.34 lakh pregnant women were not conducted. As many as 28% women were discharged within 48 hours of delivery in public institutions, says the report, and only 35.21 lakh (55%) mothers received post-partum check-up between 48 hours and 14 days after delivery due to the “apathetic attitude of service providers”, it adds. Against 93.72 lakh registered pregnancies during 2011-16, there were only 69.83 lakh deliveries. The case of missing deliveries may have an impact on the skewed sex ratio of 52:48 at birth in the state. Child immunisation: There was shortfall of 16-21% in targets set for child immunisation against seven vaccine-preventable diseases due to lack of awareness among parents and failure to mobilise women/children by the administration, the report points out. Out of 69.25 lakh live births, only 39.30 lakh (57%) infants were provided hepatitis B vaccine due to lack of storage facilities. Family planning: The State did not achieve the targeted total fertility rate (TFR) due to under-performance in family planning programme, says CAG. Against 3.03 lakh male sterilisations planned during 2011-16, only 0.83 lakh (27%) were performed. Female sterilization was a shade better at 43% and 22% of target (minilap and post-partum). There was a 42% shortfall in distribution of contraceptive pills and 49% in condoms. Short release of funds: Due to delayed submission of programme implementation plans and utilisation certificates by the state and Centre, only Rs 5,269.70 crore of the Rs 6,247.01 crore was made available for implementation of NRHM in the state. Lack of rural health centres: The state failed to create sufficient rural health centres due to lack of manpower and inadequate funds because of low allocation of funds, says the audit. There was a shortfall of 2,588 sub-centres (22%), 828 PHCs (41%) and 153 CHCs (31%). Lack of healthcare professionals: Out of 1,172 PHCs in the State, 503 were functioning without doctors as of April 2016, the CAG found. Laboratory technicians and pharmacists were not posted in 525 and 312 PHCs respectively. There was a shortfall in drugs and laboratory services, too. None of the test-checked health facilities had all the listed drugs and laboratory services as categorised under Madhya Pradesh Swasthya Seva Guarantee Yojana, the report said.

On Friday the government had announced that ayurveda, homeopathy and unani practitioners would soon be able to legally prescribe allopathic medicines in Maharashtra provided they completed a one-year course in pharmacology.  The allopathic doctors are unhappy with this decision. IMA state secretary Jayesh Lele said it takes an MBBS doctor five years to learn pharmacology. “Three years are given only to practise it. How can one learn pharmacology from a text-book in one year and be allowed to prescribe allopathic medicines?” he asked, adding it will be like playing with the patient’s life.  Homeopathic, ayurvedic and unani doctors had gone on a day’s strike earlier this week. Dr Bahubali Shah, president of Homeopathic association, Maharashtra, said that during an emergency, it becomes difficult for general practitioners or rural doctors to prescribe emergency medicines. “For some emergency problems like fever, vomiting, or dehydration, allopathic drugs work faster. It becomes a problem if non-allopathic doctors cannot prescribe them even in times of emergency,” he said.  The IMA said its legal cell will soon decide on a date to move court.

The company will be able to restart production only after it completes the required documentation and rectifies other lacunae found during an inspection of the manufacturing unit. Authorities from the state food and drug administration (FDA) inspected the unit at Nangargaon MIDC near Lonavla on Tuesday. Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner, FDA, Pune told TOI, “We found that they have not appointed a well-qualified person to supervise the manufacturing process to ensure that the products are safe and provide wholesome food. There was no laboratory to test the products. So we served notices on Maganlal Food Products that manufactures chikki, jelly and fudge.” Deshmukh pointed out that the manufacturer must have its own laboratory to test its products or it must get its products tested through a laboratory approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Another FDA official added, “They manufactured products in an unclean and dirty environment. They did not know whether the water they were using was potable. So, we served them a notice on Tuesday asking them to stop production and sale of their products until they fulfil the conditions of the Food Safety and Standards Act.” Owner of Maganlal Food Products Ashok Agarwal said, “We have been told to stop production and distribution until we fulfil certain conditions. The inspection team found some lacunae in documentation, which we will fulfil in three to four days and resume production. We have a licence for packaging but they have told us to get a licence for manufacturing and packaging. On Tuesday evening itself, I made an online application for the licence.” Agarwal added, “We obtained the requisite licence for transportation on Tuesday. We were following the old FDA norms. But now new FSSIA norms have come into force and we will follow those now onward.” The three- to four-day freeze on production and sale of goods is not expected to have a significant impact on revenue, the owner claimed. “Even so, we feel we will face a loss of around Rs50 lakh, per day,” said Agarwal.

District guardian minister Girish Mahajan said on Saturday that local manufacturing of the net would bring down the cost by 50%. Farmers have to buy imported protection nets for crops at the cost at Rs 6.5 lakh per acre.  Unseasonal rain and hailstorms badly affected grapes, pomegranates, onion and other crops in the district in February and March. The hailstorms have been hitting the district for the past three consecutive years. Hence, farmers need to focus on protective farming by utilising nets to cover their orchards and crops.  “We have to import the expensive shed nets. The 35% import duty on shed nets makes it unaffordable for farmers. Considering this, we have decided to manufacture good quality shed nets locally through private industries. We already asked two plastic companies from Jalgaon and Pune to manufacture the nets. The results are expected in next six months,” said Mahajan said during kharif review meeting of Nashik here on Saturday.  Mahajan, who is also the water resources minister, said the state had received 85% rainfall during last monsoon season. This year, the weather department has predicted satisfactory rainfall. He asked officials to ensure adequate supply of quality seeds and fertilisers to the farmers and directed them to take legal action against traders found selling bogus seeds and fertilisers in the district. Talking about the problems in the crop insurance policy, Mahajan said the policy offers insurance for the crop between October and January but does not cover the damage after February.  The government has decided to give priority to drip irrigation in the state so that farmers are able to do farming with less water that will also help increase the yield.  The agriculture department has projected 6.78 lakh hectares under kharif cultivation in the 2015-16 season for Nashik district.

The building, which was approximately 100 years old, was constructed by ML Vardhamanayya and will now be a thing of past. KR mills should have been protected: HistoriansExpressing anguish over the demolition of this historical building, NS Rangaraju, a member of the heritage committee, says, “In the name of road widening, we have lost several heritage structures on Irwin road. We have now lost the K R Mills building, which was until now, one of the oldest textile mills in Mysuru. Just a few years back, the building was purchased by a Mumbai-based businessman who started a new venture in the same building. It is sad that we are losing heritage structures one after the other.” “We call Mysuru as the heritage city, but are we serious about in protecting these buildings? KR Mills is the latest to go. Heritage buildings like Devaraja Market and Lansdowne buildings are in dilapidated stage. There could soon be a time when we may not have any heritage buildings left to be able to call Mysuru a heritage city. The authorities should have at least tried to relocate it,” says actor Poornachandra Mysore. Textile and khadi brought Gandhi to KR Mills…According to historian Ecchanuru Kumar, “Mahatma Gandhi had visited K R Mills to understand the textile industry in the south. To mark his visit, the owners back then had got a painting of Gandhi done on the wall of the building. During his visit, Gandhi stayed at Diwan Seshadri’s Iyer’s house in Mysuru. He once again visited Mysuru in 1932, when he visited Badavanalu village near Nanjangud, which was known for Khadi production.” Mysuru University does its bit to preserve historyToday, the Manasaganthori campus of the Mysuru University is home to a museum dedicated to Mahatama Gandhi and commemorates his visits here. This museum is considered as South India’s first replica of Sabarmati Ashram which houses memorabilias like Gandhi’s spinning wheel, spectacles, sandals and over 100 photographs of Gandhi that depict various crucial events of his life.

Agreeing with petitioner Sunita Tiwari's arguments through senior advocate Indira Jaising, a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said, ""Such a religious practice is covered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act"", which makes touching the genital of a girl less than 18 years an offence. Appearing for Dawoodi Bohra Women's Association for Religious Freedom (DBWRF), lawyer Abhishek Singhvi said the religious practice of ‘khafd' or ‘khatna' prevalent in the community for more than a thousand years involved nipping off a minute part of the genital which was as harmless as male circumcision. This was protected by the Constitution under the fundamental right to religion and religious practices, he said. Singhvi ploughed a lone furrow as attorney general K K Venugopal said male circumcision had certain health benefits including reduction of infection from HIV. However, the AG said female genital mutilation must be banned as it had serious consequences for women. ""It is a crime in the US, the UK, Australia, France and 27 African countries,"" he said. Jaising said a girl child who went genital mutilation suffered from a trauma which lingered into adulthood. Singhvi said the issue, like triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy, should be referred to a five-judge constitution bench to determine the constitutional validity of the religious practice, which was an intrinsic part of Islam. Venugopal differed and said, ""Unlike male circumcision, genital mutilation on a female leads to serious vaginal and uterine complications. Moreover, the fundamental right to religion and religious practice is always subject to public health and morality."" The bench asked, ""Why should anyone have the power based on religious practices to touch the genital of a girl?"" As the bench was insistent on carrying on with arguments, Singhvi cited his preoccupation and sought adjournment. The bench posted the case for detailed hearing on July 16. On April 20, the Centre had told the SC that female genital mutilation,   prevalent among Dawoodi Bohra community in India   , was already an offence under the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act. In response to Tiwari's PIL last year, the SC had issued notices to four central ministries — law and justice; health and family welfare; social justice and empowerment and women and child development, and the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Delhi. The petitioner had said the practice of ‘khatna' or ‘female circumcision' or ‘khafd' carried out on minor girls amounted to ""serious violation of the rights of children as even minors have a right of security of person, right to privacy, bodily integrity and the freedom from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment"". Tiwari had said that though Dawoodi Bohras were among the most educated sections of society in India, yet ""it is the only Muslim community in India to practice FGM or khatna. The practice has nothing to do with religion and is more of a cultural practice"". Tiwari had said the UN Convention on Rights of Child categorised four types of female genital mutilation, though the Bohras generally practised Type-I FGM, which involved snipping the tip of the clitoral hood or clitoris. ""A UN resolution passed in December 2012 denouncing FGM and calling for its ban has been signed by 194 countries around the world. In Africa, 27 countries have banned the practice. Unfortunately, there is no law in India yet against FGM, hence the clergy in India is unabashedly promoting FGM,"" Tiwari's PIL had said. India is a signatory to the 2012 UNGA resolution.

However, there might be little concession for commercial vehicles, the poll manual states. The requisition process for vehicles for the added areas of Kolkata — in seats like Jadavpur, Behala East and Behala West, Tollygunge and Kasba — began on Monday and the exercise for buses and contract carriages had begun last week. The elections here are scheduled for April 10 and several of the requisitioned vehicles have been asked to leave Kolkata for Jangalmahal on March 26 to bring back a section of CAPF and police personnel to these places after polling ends there on March 27. Some vehicles will also be requisitioned for third phase polls in South 24 Parganas. While police duties see use of buses, EC officials prefer SUVs. The QRT duty officers, too, use SUVs. An election commission official assured vehicle owners of a fair hearing. “The cars will not be taken over if the problems stated are genuine. We are first taking over government and then, commercial vehicles. But we cannot fully exhaust the two options as more people depend on the public transport system than their cars. That way, the public transport system might fall flat. We have to rationally exhaust the first two options before going in for private vehicles,” he said, adding that the Lalbazar election cell is informed by the EC of the total number of vehicles required. Not everyone was pleased by police sanction. A senior bank official tried to convince Jadavpur traffic guard cops after they requisitioned the commercial vehicle she uses to commute to work. “On Monday, she challenged our authority. We told her the commercial vehicle’s ownership lies with a third person and not the bank. We spoke to the owner and recorded his statement for future reference,” said an officer. “I told them that this is Covid times and cases are rising in Kolkata. I have been provided this car by office and I am a frontline worker as well. But they refused to listen to my pleas,” said Koushiki Saha, the bank employee. According to the poll manual, government and commercial vehicles are supposed to be used for election work and private ones are to be left untouched. But the city’s dependence on commercial vehicles has apparently forced the election commission to “keep the option open for using a few private vehicles as a last resort”. However, with most offices still persisting with the work-from-home schedule and the education sector shut, this should not be an issue this time, claimed EC officials. Among those, SUVs would be of priority to be used to ferry observers, said a source. The official explained how to apply to free a private vehicle after being taken over for poll duty. Ïf your car is requisitioned for poll duty, one can apply to the district election officer or the election commission CEO, in case the vehicle taken over usually travels across districts, stating why it will be difficult for you to function without the vehicle. Alternatively, one can use the Suvidha app and apply for relief,” he explained. Himadri Ganguly of the West Bengal Contract Carriage Association pointed out that they had written to the CEO of Bengal EC, the chief secretary and the transport secretary asking for a hike in fares. “We now receive Rs 1,910 a day. We have asked for a revised amount of Rs 2,500 a day. For mini buses, we have asked for Rs 2,000 (up from Rs 1,580). Each bus worker’s wage should be raised from Rs 170 to Rs 250 a day,” he said.

It is this legend that prompts the pre-sunrise oil bath. Feasting gets underway after the morning worship and the women are ready with a spread of the choicest savouries and sweets,” says V S Sundaram, secretary, New Bombay Tamil Sangham.  The Sikh community will visit the gurdwara. In the evening, the courtyard of GTB Nagar’s Dashmesh Darbar will be lit up with ‘deepmala’ or row of oil lamps, just as Golden Temple is on Diwali. “Diwali marks the return of Guru Hargobind who secured the release of 52 Hindu kings,” says Bhai Balbir Singh of Dashmesh Darbar.
